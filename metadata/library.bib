	abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program develops toxicologic assessments of environmental contaminants. IRIS assessments provide hazard identification and dose-response assessment information. The information is then used in conjunction with exposure information to characterize risks to public health and may be used in risk-based decisionmaking, in regulatory actions, and for other risk-management purposes. Since the middle 1990s, EPA has been in the process of updating the IRIS assessment of inorganic arsenic. In response to a congressional mandate for an independent review of the IRIS assessment of inorganic arsenic, EPA requested that the National Research Council convene a committee to conduct a two-phase study. Critical Aspects of EPA's IRIS Assessment of Inorganic Arsenic is the report of the first phase of that study. This report evaluates critical scientific issues in assessing cancer and noncancer effects of oral exposure to inorganic arsenic and offers recommendations on how the issues could be addressed in EPA's IRIS assessment.},

@article{Panda2015,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a naturally occurring element which is presents in food, water and air. Although arsenic is known to be an effective poison but some animal studies suggest that arsenic may be an essential nutrient at low concentrations. The dangers associated with long-term exposure to arsenic are now well known. Arsenic toxicity in groundwater has affected major parts of the Bengal Basin covering Bangladesh and southern West Bengal as well as other parts of the world. The metalloid arsenic has poisoned approximately 130 to 140 million people though out the world and has the highest toll in developing countries such as India. Arsenic pollution is a major and acute environmental problem affecting Bengal. The permissible limit of arsenic content in groundwater is 0.05 mg/l and it was first recorded in West Bengal in the year of 1978 that presence of arsenic in groundwater beyond this limit. The cases of arsenic poisoning were diagnosed in 1983 initially. The recommended limit of arsenic in potable water has been lowered to 0.01mg/l by the Bureau of Indian Standards. It was also reported in the literature that by the end of 2001 the problem of arsenic pollution spreads from few villages to about two thousand and sixty five villages of seventy five blocks in nine district i.e. around 9.5 million people in nine districts in southern West Bengal were affected. This is due to the over withdrawal, misuse and abuse of groundwater resource. During the past forty years, groundwater has been extensively used for irrigation and the use of phosphate fertilizers has increased enormously. Excessive withdrawal of groundwater possibly triggered mobilization of degraded organic chemicals and phosphates into the aquifer system. The arsenic-affected deltaic plains of Bengal and other such areas are free of any industrial, mining or geothermal activities and represent natural geological settings. The nature of arsenic pollution in West Bengal, diseases cause by arsenic and progress made so far is reviewed in this article completely on the basis of literature survey.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Limited epidemiologic studies have examined the association between maternal low-level lead exposure [blood lead (PbB) {\textless} 10 µg/dL] and fetal growth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: We examined whether maternal low-level lead exposure is associated with decreased fetal growth.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We linked New York State Heavy Metals Registry records of women who had PbB measurements with birth certificates to identify 43,288 mother-infant pairs in upstate New York in a retrospective cohort study from 2003 through 2005. We used multiple linear regression with fractional polynomials and logistic regression to relate birth weight, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age to PbB levels, adjusting for potential confounders. We used a closed-test procedure to identify the best fractional polynomials for PbB among 44 combinations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found a statistically significant association between PbB (square root transformed) and birth weight. Relative to 0 µg/dL, PbBs of 5 and 10 µg/dL were associated with an average of 61-g and 87-g decrease in birth weight, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for PbBs between 3.1 and 9.9 µg/dL (highest quartile) was 1.04 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.89-1.22] for preterm delivery and 1.07 (95{\%} CI, 0.93-1.23) for small for gestational age, relative to PbBs ≤ 1 µg/dL (lowest quartile). No clear dose-response trends were evident when all of the quartiles were assessed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Low-level PbB was associated with a small risk of decreased birth weight with a supralinear dose-response relationship, but was not related to preterm birth or small for gestational age. The results have important implications regarding maternal PbB.},

	abstract = {The concentration of arsenic (As) in rice grains has been identified as a risk to human health. The high proportion of inorganic species of As (As(i)) is of particular concern as it is a nonthreshold, class 1 human carcinogen. To be able to breed rice with low grain As, an understanding of genetic variation and the effect of different environments on genetic variation is needed. In this study, 13 cultivars grown at two field sites each in Bangladesh, India, and China are evaluated for grain As. There was a significant site, genotype, and site by genotype interaction for total grain As. Correlations were observed only between sites in Bangladesh and India, not between countries or within the Chinese sites. For seven cultivars the As was speciated which revealed significant effects of site, genotype, and site by genotype interaction for percentage As(i). Breeding low grain As cultivars that will have consistently low grain As and low As(i), over multiple environments using traditional breeding approaches may be difficult, although CT9993-5-10-1-M, Lemont, Azucena, and Te-qing in general had low grain As across the field sites.},

@article{Breton2006,
	abstract = {Chronic arsenic poisoning remains a public health crisis in Bangladesh. As arsenic has been shown to bind to human hemoglobin (Hb), hematologic mechanisms may play a role in the pathway through which arsenic exerts its toxicity. Two separate studies, a case-control and a cohort, were conducted to investigate the role of Hb in the development of arsenic-induced skin lesions. In the first, conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the effect of Hb on skin lesions among 900 case-control pairs from Pabna, Bangladesh, in which individuals were matched on gender, age, and location. In the second, mixed linear regression models were used to examine the association between toenail arsenic, urinary arsenic, and Hb within a cohort of 184 individuals from 50 families in the same region who did not have arsenic-induced skin lesions. Hb was significantly associated with skin lesions but this association was gender specific. In males, a 40{\%} reduction in the odds of skin lesions occurred for every 1 g/dL increase in Hb (odds ratio, 0.60; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.49-0.73). No effect was observed for females (odds ratio, 1.16; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.92-1.46). In the cohort of 184 individuals, no associations between toenail arsenic or urinary arsenic species and Hb levels were observed. Low Hb levels may exacerbate the detrimental health effects of chronic arsenic poisoning. Whereas providing clean water remains the optimal solution to Bangladesh's problem of arsenic poisoning, improving nutrition and reducing iron-deficiency anemia may ameliorate negative health effects, such as skin lesions in individuals who have been exposed.},

A systematic review to examine the geographical distribution of arsenic-related diseases in Argentina was conducted, searching electronic databases and gray literature up to November 2013. Key infor-mants were also contacted. Of the 430 references identified, 47 (mostly cross-sectional and ecological designs) referred to arsenic concentration in water and its relationship with the incidence and mortality of cancer, derma-tological diseases and genetic disorders. A high percentage of the water samples had arsenic concentrations above the WHO threshold value of 10 $\mu$g/L, especially in the province of Buenos Aires. The median prevalence of arsenicosis was 2.6{\%} in exposed areas. The proportion of skin cancer in patients with arsenicosis reached 88{\%} in case-series from the Buenos Aires province. We found higher incidence rate ratios per 100 $\mu$g/L increment in inorganic arsenic concentration for colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and skin cancer, for both genders. Liver and skin cancer mortality risk ratios were higher in regions with medium/high concentrations than in those with low concentrations. The relative risk of mortality by skin cancer associated to arsenic exposure in the province of Buenos Aires ranged from 2.5 to 5.2. In the north of this province, high levels of arsenic in drinking water were reported; however, removal interventions were scarcely documented. Arsenic contamination in Argentina is as-sociated with an increased risk of serious chronic diseases, including cancer, showing the need for adequate and timely actions.},

@article{Heys2016,
	abstract = {In the environment, organisms are exposed to a diverse array of chemicals in complex mixtures. The majority of approaches that aim to assess the risk of environmental chemical mixtures, including those used by regulatory bodies, use toxicity data generated from the individual component chemicals to predict the overall mixture toxicity. It is assumed that the behaviour of chemicals in a mixture can be predicted using the concepts of concentration or dose addition for chemicals with similar mechanisms of action or response addition for dissimilarly acting chemicals. Based on empirical evidence, most traditional risk assessment methods, such as Toxic Equivalency Factors and the Hazard Index, make the assumption that the components of a mixture adhere to the concentration addition model. Thus, mixture toxicity can be predicted by the summation of the individual component toxicities. However in some mixtures, interactions can occur between chemicals or at target sites that alter the toxicity so that it is more or less than expected from the constituents. Many regulatory and experimental methods for predicting mixture toxicity rely on the use of a concentration addition model so that if interactions occur in mixtures, the risk posed may have been significantly underestimated. This is particularly concerning when considering environmental mixtures which are often highly complex and composed of indeterminate chemicals. Failure to accurately predict the effects chemicals will have if released into the environment, where they can form mixtures, can lead to unexpected detrimental effects on wildlife and ecosystems. The number of confounding factors that may alter the ecotoxicity of a mixture and the accuracy of predictive methods makes risk assessment of environmental mixtures a complex and intimidating task. With this in mind, this review aims show why accurate risk assessment of mixtures is vital by demonstrating the effect they can have on organisms in the environment. Furthermore, it also aims to look at the current challenges facing the assessment of mixture effects and examines future areas of focus that seek to develop methodologies more suitable for environmental mixtures.},

Special attention is necessary to pay to the children aged 10 years or more because they are in mid of physical growth as well as mental and social development. In this cross-sectional study, 130 junior high school students (14 and 15 years old) from Narayanganj district (highly As-contaminated area) of Dhaka division in Bangladesh were selected to investigate the effect of As exposure on intelligence quotient (IQ) and social competence (SC). Visiting each student's house, information about the socio-economic status (SES) and drinking habits were collected. Urine samples were collected at school and brought back to Japan to analyze total arsenic concentration ([As]u), which was used as an index of As exposure. Student IQ was assessed with the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test; while the Bengali version of Texas Social Behavior Inventory (TSBI) Form-A was employed for measuring SC. From the result, [As]u was significantly related with SES (especially household income). More important is that [As]u was significantly related with IQ and SC. The high [As]u group showed significantly lower IQ and SC values than the low [As]u group after SES variables were controlled. It was concluded that children's IQ and SC were affected by chronic As exposure and these adverse effects may also gradually accumulate among the poor. {\textcopyright} 2012 Academic Journals Inc.},

Various initiatives have focused on rice to decrease hunger and malnutrition, since rice feeds most of the world's poor population. Rice bran, derived from whole grain rice, is currently an under-utilized food ingredient that presents a tremendous opportunity for dietary inclusion. Emerging evidence indicates that bioactive components found in rice bran have disease-fighting properties related to both infectious and chronic diseases. The addition of rice bran as a food ingredient into culturally acceptable, nutritious foods has health-promoting significance across the lifespan, ranging from complementary foods to widely consumed food products. This chapter addresses the challenges and opportunities for widespread rice bran consumption, and highlights how rice varietal differences in bioactive components merit investigation for health properties. Moreover, public health nutrition education for rice bran will be an important next step for the sustainable development of region-specific dietary intake.},

Among 433 cases of breast cancer identified during 4 years of follow-up and their matched controls, the odds ratios comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles and adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors were as follows: for arsenic, 1.12 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.91); for copper, 0.91 (95{\%} CI 0.59-1.42); for chromium, 0.96 (95{\%} CI 0.61-1.52); for iron, 0.89 (95{\%} CI 0.56-1.40); and for zinc, 1.09 (95{\%} CI 0.70-1.70). Among postmenopausal women, a marginally significant positive association was observed between toenail chromium levels and breast cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.71, 95{\%} CI 0.87-3.35) (p for trend = 0.07). However, the association between chromium and breast cancer risk was inverse among premenopausal women. Although data on the validity of toenail levels of certain of these elements are limited, these results do not provide evidence for an important effect of arsenic, copper, chromium, iron, or zinc on breast cancer risk.},

@article{Wheeler2021,
	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in the literature on multiple environmental risk factors for diseases and an increasing emphasis on assessing multiple environmental exposures simultaneously in epidemiologic studies of cancer. One method used to analyze exposure to multiple chemical exposures is weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. While WQS regression has been demonstrated to have good sensitivity and specificity when identifying important exposures, it has limitations including a two-step model fitting process that decreases power and model stability and a requirement that all exposures in the weighted index have associations in the same direction with the outcome, which is not realistic when chemicals in different classes have different directions and magnitude of association with a health outcome. Grouped WQS (GWQS) was proposed to allow for multiple groups of chemicals in the model where different magnitude and direction of associations are possible for each group. However, GWQS shares the limitation of WQS of a two-step estimation process and splitting of data into training and validation sets. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian group index model to avoid the estimation limitation of GWQS while having multiple exposure indices in the model. To evaluate the performance of the Bayesian group index model, we conducted a simulation study with several different exposure scenarios. We also applied the Bayesian group index method to analyze childhood leukemia risk in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS). The results showed that the Bayesian group index model had slightly better power for exposure effects and specificity and sensitivity in identifying important chemical exposure components compared with the existing frequentist method, particularly for small sample sizes. In the application to the CCLS, we found a significant negative association for insecticides, with the most important chemical being carbaryl. In addition, for children who were born and raised in the home where dust samples were taken, there was a significant positive association for herbicides with dacthal being the most important exposure. In conclusion, our approach of the Bayesian group index model appears able to make a substantial contribution to the field of environmental epidemiology.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends weight-for-length/height (WFL/H), represented as a Z score for diagnosing acute malnutrition among children aged 0 to 60 months. Under controlled conditions, weight, height and length measurements have high degree of reliability. However, the reliability when combined into a WFL/H Z score, in all settings is unclear. We conducted a systematic review of published studies assessing the reliability of WFL/Hz on PubMed and Google scholar. Studies were included if they presented reliability scores for the derived index of WFL/Hz, for children under 5 years. Meta-analysis was conducted for a pooled estimate of reliability overall, and for children above and below 24 months old. Twenty six studies on reliability of anthropometry were identified but only three, all community-based studies, reported reliability scores for WFL/Hz. The overall pooled intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) estimate for WFL/Hz among children aged 0 to 60 months was 0.81 (95{\%} CI 0.64 to 0.99). Among children aged less than 24 months the pooled ICC estimate from two studies was 0.72 (95{\%} CI 0.67 to 0.77) while the estimate reported for children above 24 months from one study was 0.97 (95{\%} CI 0.97 to 0.99). Although WFL/Hz is recommended for diagnosis of acute under nutrition among children below 5 years, information on its reliability in all settings is sparse. In community settings, reliability of WFL/Hz is considerably lower than for absolute measures of weight and length/height, especially in younger children. The reliability of WFL/Hz needs further evaluation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major pregnancy complication with detrimental effects for both mothers and their children. Accumulating evidence has suggested a potential role for arsenic (As) exposure in the development of GDM, but current studies have not assessed As exposure from water, urine or toenail samples. METHODS We investigated the association between As exposure and risk of glucose intolerance and GDM among 1151 women enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Arsenic was measured in home well water and via biomarkers (i.e., maternal urine collected {\~{}}24-28 weeks gestation and toenail clippings collected 2 weeks postpartum). RESULTS A total of 105 (9.1 {\%}) of women were diagnosed with glucose intolerance and 14 (1.2 {\%}) of women were diagnosed with GDM. A total of 10.3 {\%} of women had water As levels above 10 $\mu$g/L, with a mean As level of 4.2. Each 5 $\mu$g/L increase in As concentration in home well water was associated with a {\~{}}10 {\%} increased odds of GDM (OR: 1.1, 95 {\%} CI 1.0, 1.2). A positive and statistically significant association also was observed between toenail As and GDM (OR: 4.5, 95 {\%} CI 1.2, 16.6), but not urinary arsenic (OR: 0.8, 95 {\%} CI 0.3, 2.4). In a stratified analysis, the association between water As and GDM and glucose intolerance was largely limited to obese women (OR: 1.7, 95 {\%} CI 1.0, 2.8). CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the role of As exposure via water from private wells in the incidence of GDM and that this association may be modified by body composition.},

Objectives: We aimed to assess the joint effect of in utero exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on children's neurodevelopment. Methods: We employed a novel statistical approach, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), to study the joint effect of coexposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on neurodevelopment using an adapted Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development{\texttrademark}. Third Edition, in 825 mother--child pairs recruited into a prospective birth cohort from two clinics in the Pabna and Sirajdikhan districts of Bangladesh. Metals were measured in cord blood using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results: Analyses were stratified by clinic due to differences in exposure profiles. In the Pabna district, which displayed high manganese levels [interquartile range (IQR): 4.8, 18 $\mu$g/dl], we found a statistically significant negative effect of the mixture of arsenic, lead, and manganese on cognitive score when cord blood metals concentrations were all above the 60th percentile (As≥0.7 $\mu$g/dl, Mn≥6.6 $\mu$g/dl, Pb≥4.2 $\mu$g/dl) compared to the median (As=0.5 $\mu$g/dl, Mn=5.8 $\mu$g/dl, Pb=3.1 $\mu$g/dl). Evidence of a nonlinear effect of manganese was found. A change in log manganese from the 25th to the 75th percentile when arsenic and manganese were at the median was associated with a decrease in cognitive score of −0.3 (−0.5, −0.1) standard deviations. Our study suggests that arsenic might be a potentiator of manganese toxicity. Conclusions: Employing a novel statistical method for the study of the health effects of chemical mixtures, we found evidence of neurotoxicity of the mixture, as well as potential synergism between arsenic and manganese.},

	abstract = {Chronic ingestion of arsenic from drinking water is associated with the occurrence of skin cancer. To clarify the role of arsenic methylation capacity in the development of arsenic-associated skin lesions, an epidemiological case-control study was conducted in the southwestern region of Taiwan, in which 26 skin disorder patients were matched with control subjects. The objective of this study was to determine whether arsenic methylation capacity of patients with skin disorders differed from that of matched controls. Both cases and controls had been exposed to similar high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. Results indicated that skin lesion cases had higher percents of inorganic arsenic (InAs, 13.1 $\pm$ 3.7{\%}), methylarsonic acid (MMA, 16.4 $\pm$ 3.2{\%}), lower percent of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA, 70.5 $\pm$ 5.8{\%}), and higher ratio of MMA to DMA (MMA/DMA, 0.24 $\pm$ 0.06) than matched controls (InAs: 11.43 $\pm$ 2.1{\%}; MMA: 14.6 $\pm$ 2.6{\%}; DMA: 73.9 $\pm$ 3.3{\%}; MMA/DMA: 0.20 $\pm$ 0.04). Individuals with a higher percentage of MMA ({\textgreater}15.5{\%}) had an odds ratio of developing skin disorder 5.5 times (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.22-24.81) higher than those having a lower percentage of MMA. This association was not confounded by hepatitis B surface antigen, cigarette smoking, or alcohol and tea consumption. It is concluded that arsenic biotransformation including methylation capacity may have a role in the development of arsenic-induced skin disorders.},

@article{Islam2017,
	abstract = {An in vivo assay using swine was used to measure the absolute bioavailability (AB) of As from cooked rice of twelve genotypes commonly grown in Bangladesh. An assessment of both total As in rice and its bioavailability is crucial for estimating human exposure following dietary intake by the local community. Average As concentrations in each rice genotype ranged from 108 $\pm$ 4 $\mu$g/kg to 580 $\pm$ 6 $\mu$g/kg. Arsenic speciation shows that most of the rice genotype contains 73 to 100{\%} inorganic As. Swine were administered with As orally and via intravenous method, i.e. injection and fed certain common Bangladeshi rice genotypes (cooked). Swine blood As levels were measured to calculate As bioavailability from rice. Pilot studies shows that for As(III) and As(V), 90.8 $\pm$ 12.4{\%} and 85.0 $\pm$ 19.2{\%} of the administered oral dose was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract whereas organic As was poorly absorbed resulting in low bioavailability values 20.2 $\pm$ 2.6{\%} (MMA) to 31.2 $\pm$ 3.4{\%} (DMA), respectively. These studies demonstrates that rice genotypic characters influenced As bioavailability in rice grown in As-contaminated areas and the bioavailability varied between 25{\%} and 94{\%}. Arsenic in salt tolerant rice genotypes Binadhan-10 and BRRI dhan47 as well as brown rice genotypes Kheali Boro and Local Boro has lower bioavailability ({\textless} 50{\%}) compared to other rice genotypes. The most commonly cultivated and consumed variety (BRRI dhan28) has As bioavailability of 70{\%}, which poses a significant risk to consumers. Calculation of maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI) for humans due to consumption of rice based on bioavailability data was higher than those calculated based on inorganic and organic As concentration in rice genotypes.},

	abstract = {Background: The available evidence on the role of arsenic metabolism in individual susceptibility to the development of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes has not been formally and comprehensively reviewed. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to systematically investigate the association of arsenic metabolism with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes- related outcomes in epidemiologic studies. As a secondary objective, we characterized the variation of arsenic metabolism in different populations worldwide. Methods: We searched Medline/PubMed and EMBASE from inception to January 2016 and applied predetermined exclusion criteria. Compositional data analysis was used to describe the distribution of arsenic metabolism biomarkers and evaluate the association between arsenic exposure and metabolism. Results: Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, 12 on cancer, nine on cardiovascular disease, and seven on diabetes-related outcomes. The median (interquartile range) for mean iAs{\%}, MMA{\%}, and DMA{\%} was 11.2 (7.8-14.9){\%}, 13.0 (10.4-13.6){\%}, and 74.9 (69.8-80.0){\%}, respectively. Findings across studies suggested that higher arsenic exposure levels were associated with higher iAs{\%} and lower DMA{\%} and not associated with MMA{\%}. For cancer, most studies found a pattern of higher MMA{\%} and lower DMA{\%} associated with higher risk of all-site, urothelial, lung, and skin cancers. For cardiovascular disease, higher MMA{\%} was generally associated with higher risk of carotid atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascular disease but not with hypertension. For diabetes-related outcomes, the pattern of lower MMA{\%} and higher DMA{\%} was associated with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Conclusions: Population level of iAs{\%} and DMA{\%}, but not MMA{\%}, were associated with arsenic exposure levels. Overall, study findings suggest that higher MMA{\%} was associated with an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease, while lower MMA{\%} was associated with an increased risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Additional population-based studies and experimental studies are needed to further evaluate and understand the role of arsenic exposure in arsenic metabolism and the role of arsenic metabolism in disease development.},

	abstract = {Following a request from the European Commission to carry out a risk benefit analysis as regards the risks and benefits to human health of fish/seafood consumption related to methylmercury, the EFSA Scientific Committee used previous work performed by the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain and the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies to create scenarios based on typical fish consumption patterns of population groups at risk of exceeding the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for methylmercury. The Scientific Committee then estimated how many servings of fish/seafood per week these population groups would need to reach the TWI for methylmercury and the dietary reference value (DRV) for n-3 (Long-Chain) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (LCPUFA). When consuming species with a high methylmercury content, only a few numbers of servings ({\textless}1-2) can be eaten before reaching the TWI, which may be attained before the DRV. To protect against inter alia neurodevelopmental toxicity of methylmercury and achieve the benefits of fish consumption (effect of fish/seafood consumption during pregnancy on functional outcomes of children's neurodevelopment and on cardiovascular diseases in adults), which are associated with 1--4 fish servings per week, fish/seafood species with a high content of mercury in the daily diet should be limited. Because a variety of fish species are consumed across Europe, it is not possible to make general recommendations on fish consumption. The Scientific Committee therefore recommends that each country needs to consider its own pattern of fish consumption, especially the species of fish consumed, and carefully assess the risk of exceeding the TWI of methylmercury while obtaining the health benefits from consumption of fish/seafood.},

	abstract = {Arsenic exposure is associated with cancer and vascular diseases. Angiogenesis is an important step for the pathological development of cancer and vascular diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a specific marker for angiogenesis. However, human study showing the association between arsenic exposure and serum VEGF levels has not yet been documented. This study was aimed to investigate the association between arsenic exposure and serum VEGF levels in the arsenic-endemic individuals in Bangladesh. A total of 260 individuals were recruited for this study. Arsenic exposure levels were measured by ICP-MS and VEGF levels were quantified using VEGF immunoassay kit. The study subjects were stratified into tertile (low, medium and high) groups based on the arsenic in water, hair and nails. Serum VEGF levels were correlated with water (rs=0.363, p{\textless}0.001), hair (rs=0.205, p{\textless}0.01) and nail (rs=0.190, p{\textless}0.01) arsenic. Further, VEGF levels showed dose-response relationships with water, hair and nail arsenic. Mean VEGF levels in≤10$\mu$gL-1, 10.1-50 $\mu$gL-1and {\textgreater} 50$\mu$gL-1groups were 91.84, 129.54, and 169.86pgmL-1, respectively, however, significant (p{\textless}0.01) difference in VEGF levels was only found in {\textgreater} 50$\mu$gL-1versus ≤10$\mu$gL-1groups. Significant associations of arsenic exposure with VEGF levels were found even after adjusting with relevant covariates. Therefore, these results provide evidence that arsenic exposure has a pro-angiogenic effect on humans, which may be implicated in arsenic-induced tumorigenesis and vascular diseases.},

@article{Gruber2012,
	abstract = {Background: Dietary factors such as folate, vitamin B12, protein, and methionine are important for the excretion of arsenic via one-carbon metabolism in undernourished populations exposed to high levels of arsenic via drinking water. However, the effects of dietary factors on toenail arsenic concentrations in well-nourished populations exposed to relatively low levels of water arsenic are unknown. Methods: As part of a population-based case-control study of skin and bladder cancer from the USA, we evaluated relationships between consumption of dietary factors and arsenic concentrations in toenail clippings. Consumption of each dietary factor was determined from a validated food frequency questionnaire. We used general linear models to examine the associations between toenail arsenic and each dietary factor, taking into account potentially confounding effects. Results: As expected, we found an inverse association between ln-transformed toenail arsenic and consumption of vitamin B12 (excluding supplements) and animal protein. Unexpectedly, there were also inverse associations with numerous dietary lipids (e.g., total fat, total animal fat, total vegetable fat, total monounsaturated fat, total polyunsaturated fat, and total saturated fat). Finally, increased toenail arsenic concentrations were associated with increased consumption of long chain n-3 fatty acids. Conclusion: In a relatively well-nourished population exposed to relatively low levels of arsenic via water, consumption of certain dietary lipids may decrease toenail arsenic concentration, while long chain n-3 fatty acids may increase toenail arsenic concentration, possibly due to their association with arsenolipids in fish tissue. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gruber et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is one of the oldest poisons known to men. Its applications throughout history are wide and varied: murder, make-up, paint and even as a pesticide. Chronic As toxicity is a global environmental health problem, affecting millions of people in the USA and Germany to Bangladesh and Taiwan. Worldwide, As is released into the environment by smelting of various metals, combustion of fossil fuels, as herbicides and fungicides in agricultural products. The drinking water in many countries, which is tapped from natural geological resources, is also contaminated as a result of the high level of As in groundwater. The environmental fate of As is contamination of surface and groundwater with a contaminant level higher than 10 particle per billion (ppb) as set by World Health Organization (WHO). Arsenic exists in both organic and inorganic species and either form can also exist in a trivalent or pentavalent oxidation state. Long-term health effects of exposure to these As metabolites are severe and highly variable: skin and lung cancer, neurological effects, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Neurological effects of As may develop within a few hours after ingestion, but usually are seen in 2-8 weeks after exposure. It is usually a symmetrical sensorimotor neuropathy, often resembling the Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome. The predominant clinical features of neuropathy are paresthesias, numbness and pain, particularly in the soles of the feet. Electrophysiological studies performed on patients with As neuropathy have revealed a reduced nerve conduction velocity, typical of those seen in axonal degeneration. Most of the adverse effects of As, are caused by inactivated enzymes in the cellular energy pathway, whereby As reacts with the thiol groups of proteins and enzymes and inhibits their catalytic activity. Furthermore, As-induced neurotoxicity, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, causes changes in cytoskeletal protein composition and hyperphosphorylation. These changes may lead to disorganization of the cytoskeletal framework, which is a potential mechanism of As-induced neurotoxicity. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

	abstract = {Objective To examine patterns of microbial colonization of the respiratory and intestinal tracts in early life in infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their associations with breastfeeding and clinical outcomes. Study design A comprehensive, prospective longitudinal analysis of the upper respiratory and intestinal microbiota in a cohort of infants and young children with CF followed from birth was performed. Genus-level microbial community composition was characterized using 16S-targeted pyrosequencing, and relationships with exposures and outcomes were assessed using linear mixed-effects models, time-to-event analysis, and principal components analysis. Results Sequencing of 120 samples from 13 subjects collected from birth to 34 months revealed relationships between breastfeeding, microbial diversity in the respiratory and intestinal tracts, and the timing of onset of respiratory complications, including exacerbations and colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fluctuations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa preceded clinical outcomes, including a significant decrease in bacteria of the genus Parabacteroides within the intestinal tract prior to the onset of chronic P aeruginosa colonization. Specific assemblages of bacteria in intestinal samples, but not respiratory samples, were associated with CF exacerbation in early life, indicating that the intestinal microbiome may play a role in lung health. Conclusions Our findings relating breastfeeding to respiratory outcomes, gut diversity to prolonged periods of health, and specific bacterial communities in the gut prior to respiratory complications in CF highlight a connection between the intestinal microbiome and health and point to potential opportunities for antibiotic or probiotic interventions. Further studies in larger cohorts validating these findings are needed.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the detected levels of inorganic arsenic (As i) in rice cereal in the U.S. market are safe for consumption by infants and toddlers. A risk assessment was conducted based on literature reviews of the reported As i in rice cereal from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) survey and the recommended daily intake of rice cereal by body weight, for infants and toddlers between four and 24 months old. As a part of risk management, a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for As i in rice cereal was computed considering overall exposure sources including drinking water, infant formula, and other infant solid foods. Hazard quotients (HQs) for acute and chronic exposures were calculated based on the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's (ATSDR) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) acute (5.0 × 10 −3 mg/kg/day) and MRL chronic (3.0 × 10 −4 mg/kg/day). A cancer slope or potency factor of 1.5 mg/kg/day was used to predict an incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). Exposure assessment showed that the largest source of As i for infants and toddlers between four and 24 months old was rice cereal (55{\%}), followed by other infant solid food (19{\%}), and drinking water (18{\%}). Infant formula was the smallest source of As i for babies (9{\%}) at the 50th percentile based on Monte Carlo simulations. While HQ acute were consistently below 1.0, HQ chronic at the 50 and 75th percentiles exceeded 1.0 for both rice cereal and total sources. ILCR ranged from 10 −6 (50th) to 10 −5 (75th percentile). MCLs for As i in rice cereal ranged from 0.0 (chronic) to 0.4 mg/kg (acute exposures).},

This i-As content needs to be reduced to make rice bran a useful food ingredient. Evaluated here is a novel approach to minimizing rice bran i-As content which is also suitable for its stabilization namely, cooking bran in percolating arsenic-free boiling water. Up to 96{\%} of i-As removal was observed for a range of rice bran products, with i-As removal related to the volume of cooking water used. This process reduced the copper, potassium, and phosphorus content, but had little effect on other trace- and macro-nutrient elements in the rice bran. There was little change in organic composition, as assayed by NIR, except for a decrease in the soluble sugar and an increase, due to biomass loss, in dietary fiber.},

	abstract = {Despite the global importance of As in rice, research has primarily focused on Bangladesh, India, China, and the United States with limited attention given to other countries. Owing to both indigenous As within the soil and the possible increases arising from the onset of irrigation with groundwater, an assessment of As in rice within Cambodia is needed, which offers a "base-case" comparison against sediments of similar origin that comprise rice paddy soils where As-contaminated water is used for irrigation (e.g., Bangladesh). Here, we evaluated the As content of rice from five provinces (Kandal, Prey Veng, Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Kampong Thom) in the rice-growing regions of Cambodia and coupled that data to soil-chemical factors based on extractions of paddy soil collected and processed under anoxic conditions. At total soil As concentrations ranging 0.8 to 18 $\mu$g g(-1), total grain As concentrations averaged 0.2 $\mu$g g(-1) and ranged from 0.1 to 0.37 with Banteay Meanchey rice having significantly higher values than Prey Veng rice. Overall, soil-extractable concentrations of As, Fe, P, and Si and total As were poor predictors of grain As concentrations. While biogeochemical factors leading to reduction of As(V)-bearing Fe(III) oxides are likely most important for predicting plant-available As, husk and straw As concentrations were the most significant predictors of grain-As levels among our measured parameters.},

	abstract = {Background: Respiratory infections continue to be a public health threat, particularly to young children in developing countries. Understanding the geographic patterns of diseases and the role of potential risk factors can help improve future mitigation efforts. Toward this goal, this paper applies a spatial scan statistic combined with a zero-inflated negative-binomial regression to re-examine the impacts of a community-based treatment program on the geographic patterns of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) mortality in an area of rural Bangladesh. Exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water is also a serious threat to the health of children in this area, and the variation in exposure to arsenic must be considered when evaluating the health interventions. Methods: ALRI mortality data were obtained for children under 2 years old from 1989 to 1996 in the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System. This study period covers the years immediately following the implementation of an ALRI control program. A zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was first used to simultaneously estimate mortality rates and the likelihood of no deaths in groups of related households while controlling for socioeconomic status, potential arsenic exposure, and access to care. Next a spatial scan statistic was used to assess the location and magnitude of clusters of ALRI mortality. The ZINB model was used to adjust the scan statistic for multiple social and environmental risk factors. Results: The results of the ZINB models and spatial scan statistic suggest that the ALRI control program was successful in reducing child mortality in the study area. Exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water was not associated with increased mortality. Higher socioeconomic status also significantly reduced mortality rates, even among households who were in the treatment program area. Conclusion: Community-based ALRI interventions can be effective at reducing child mortality, though socioeconomic factors may continue to influence mortality patterns. The combination of spatial and non-spatial methods used in this paper has not been applied previously in the literature, and this study demonstrates the importance of such approaches for evaluating and improving public health intervention programs.},

@article{Juhasz2006,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of people worldwide consume arsenic-contaminated rice; however, little is known about the uptake and bioavailability of arsenic species after arsenic-contaminated rice ingestion. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed arsenic speciation in greenhouse-grown and supermarket-bought rice, and determined arsenic bioavailability in cooked rice using an in vivo swine model. RESULTS: In supermarket-bought rice, arsenic was present entirely in the inorganic form compared to greenhouse-grown rice (using irrigation water contaminated with sodium arsenate), where most (approximately 86{\%}) arsenic was present as dimethylarsinic acid (organic arsenic). Because of the low absolute bioavailability of dimethylarsinic acid and the high proportion of dimethylarsinic acid in greenhouse-grown rice, only 33 +/- 3{\%} (mean +/- SD) of the total rice-bound arsenic was bioavailable. Conversely, in supermarket-bought rice cooked in water contaminated with sodium arsenate, arsenic was present entirely in the inorganic form, and bioavailability was high (89 +/- 9{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that arsenic bioavailability in rice is highly dependent on arsenic speciation, which in turn can vary depending on rice cultivar, arsenic in irrigation water, and the presence and nature of arsenic speciation in cooking water. Arsenic speciation and bioavailability are therefore critical parameters for reducing uncertainties when estimating exposure from the consumption of rice grown and cooked using arsenic-contaminated water.},

	abstract = {This systematic review synthesizes the diverse body of epidemiologic research accrued on inorganic arsenic exposure and respiratory health effects. Twenty-nine articles were identified that examined the relationship between inorganic arsenic exposure and respiratory outcomes (i.e. lung function, symptoms, acute respiratory infections, chronic non-malignant lung diseases, and non-malignant lung disease mortality). There was strong evidence of a general association between arsenic and non-malignant respiratory illness, including consistent evidence on lung function impairment, acute respiratory tract infections, respiratory symptoms, and non-malignant lung disease mortality. Overall, early life exposure (i.e. in utero and/or early-childhood) had a marked effect throughout the lifespan. This review also identified some research gaps, including limited evidence at lower levels of exposure (water arsenic {\textless}100. $\mu$g/L), mixed evidence of sex differences, and some uncertainty on arsenic and any single non-malignant respiratory disease or pathological process. Common limitations, including potential publication bias; non-comparability of outcome measures across included articles; incomplete exposure histories; and limited confounder control attenuated the cumulative strength of the evidence as it relates to US populations. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the epidemiologic evidence and should be used to guide future research on arsenic's detrimental effects on respiratory health.},

	abstract = {Huelva (South West Spain) and its surrounding municipalities represent one of the most polluted estuaries in the world owing to the discharge of mining and industrial related pollutants in their proximity. A biomonitoring study was conducted to assess exposure to arsenic and some trace metals (cadmium, mercury, manganese and lead) in urine and scalp hair from a representative sample of children aged 6-9. years (. n=. 261). This is the only study simultaneously analyzing those five metal elements in children urine and hair. The potential contribution of gender, water consumption, residence area and body mass index on urinary and hair metal concentrations was also studied. Urine levels of cadmium and total mercury in a proportion (25-50{\%}) of our children population living near industrial/mining areas might have an impact on health, likely due to environmental exposure to metal pollution. The only significant correlation between urine and hair levels was found for mercury. Children living near agriculture areas showed increased levels of cadmium and manganese (in urine) and arsenic (in hair). In contrast, decreased urine Hg concentrations were observed in children living near mining areas. Girls exhibited significantly higher trace metal concentrations in hair than boys. The greatest urine arsenic concentrations were found in children drinking well/spring water. Although human hair can be a useful tool for biomonitoring temporal changes in metal concentrations, levels are not correlated with those found in urine except for total mercury, thus providing additional information.},

	abstract = {Background Shortening of gestation and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are the two main determinants of birthweight. Low birthweight has been linked with prenatal arsenic exposure, but the causal relation between arsenic and birthweight is not well understood. Objectives We applied a quantile causal mediation analysis approach to determine the association between prenatal arsenic exposure and birthweight in relation to shortening of gestation and IUGR, and whether the susceptibility of arsenic exposure varies by infant birth sizes. Methods In a longitudinal birth cohort in Bangladesh, we measured arsenic in drinking water (n = 1182) collected at enrollment and maternal toenails (n = 1104) collected ≤ 1-month postpartum using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Gestational age was determined using ultrasound at ≤ 16 weeks' gestation. Demographic information was collected using a structured questionnaire. Results Of 1184 singleton livebirths, 16.4{\%} (n = 194) were low birthweight ({\textless} 2500 g), 21.9{\%} (n = 259) preterm ({\textless} 37 weeks' gestation), and 9.2{\%} (n = 109) both low birthweight and preterm. The median concentrations of arsenic in drinking water and maternal toenails were 2.2 $\mu$g/L (range: below the level of detection [LOD] − 1400) and 1.2 $\mu$g/g (range: {\textless} LOD − 46.6), respectively. Prenatal arsenic exposure was negatively associated with birthweight, where the magnitude of the association varied across birthweight percentiles. The effect of arsenic on birthweight mediated via shortening of gestation affected all infants irrespective of birth sizes ($\beta$ range: 10th percentile = − 19.7 g [95{\%} CI: − 26.7, − 13.3] to 90th percentile = − 10.9 g [95{\%} CI: − 18.5, − 5.9] per natural log water arsenic increase), whereas the effect via pathways independent of gestational age affected only the smaller infants ($\beta$ range: 10th percentile = − 28.0 g [95{\%} CI: − 43.8, − 9.9] to 20th percentile = − 14.9 g [95{\%} CI: − 30.3, − 1.7] per natural log water arsenic increase). Similar pattern was observed for maternal toenail arsenic. Conclusions The susceptibility of prenatal arsenic exposure varied by infant birth sizes, placing smaller infants at greater risk of lower birthweight by shortening of gestation and possibly growth restriction. It is important to mitigate prenatal arsenic exposure to improve perinatal outcomes in Bangladesh.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Increasing awareness of the prevalence and significance of Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry (PRISm), alternatively known as restrictive or Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)-unclassified spirometry, has expanded the body of knowledge on cross-sectional risk factors. However, longitudinal studies of PRISm remain limited. Objectives: To examine longitudinal patterns of change in lung function, radiographic characteristics, and mortality of current and former smokers with PRISm. Methods: Current and former smokers, aged 45 to 80 years, were enrolled in COPDGene (phase 1, 2008-2011) and returned for a 5-year follow-up (phase 2, 2012-2016). Subjects completed questionnaires, spirometry, chest computed tomography scans, and 6-minute-walk tests at both study visits. Baseline characteristics, longitudinal change in lung function, and mortality were assessed by post-bronchodilator lung function categories: PRISm (FEV1/FVC, 0.7 and FEV1 , 80{\%}), GOLD0 (FEV1/FVC . 0.7 and FEV1 . 80{\%}), and GOLD1-4 (FEV1/FVC, 0.7). Measurements and Main Results: Although the prevalence of PRISm was consistent (12.4-12.5{\%}) at phases 1 and 2, subjects with PRISm exhibited substantial rates of transition to and from other lung function categories. Among subjects with PRISm at phase 1, 22.2{\%} transitioned to GOLD0 and 25.1{\%} progressed to GOLD1-4 at phase 2. Subjects with PRISm at both phase 1 and phase 2 had reduced rates of FEV1 decline (227.3 6 42.1 vs. 233.0 6 41.7 ml/yr) and comparable proportions of normal computed tomography scans (51{\%} vs. 52.7{\%}) relative to subjects with stable GOLD0 spirometry. In contrast, incident PRISm exhibited accelerated rates of lung function decline. Subjects with PRISm at phase 1 had higher mortality rates relative to GOLD0 and lower rates relative to the GOLD1-4 group. Conclusions: PRISm is highly prevalent, is associated with increased mortality, and represents a transitional state for significant subgroups of subjects. Additional studies to characterize longitudinal progression in PRISm are warranted.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The role of air pollution exposure in the development of asthma, allergies,andrelatedsymptomsremains unclear,duein part to the limited number of prospective cohort studies with sufficiently long follow-ups addressing this problem. Objectives: We studied the association between traffic-related air pollution and the development of asthma, allergy, and related symptoms in a prospective birth cohort study with a unique 8-year follow-up. Methods: Annual questionnaire reports of asthma, hay fever, and related symptoms during the first 8 years of life were analyzed for 3,863 children. At age 8, measurements of allergic sensitization and bronchial hyperresponsiveness were performed for subpopulations (n = 1,700 and 936, respectively). Individual exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), particulate matter (PM 2.5), and soot at the birth address were estimated by land-use regression models. Associations between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and repeated measures of health outcomes were assessed by repeated-measures logistic regression analysis. Effects are presented for an interquartile range increase in exposure after adjusting for covariates. Measurements and Main Results: Annual prevalence was 3 to 6{\%} for asthma and 12 to 23{\%} for asthma symptoms. Annual incidence of asthma was 6{\%}at age 1, and 1 to 2{\%}at later ages. PM 2.5 levels were associated with a significant increase in incidence of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 1.28;95{\%}confidenceinterval [CI], 1.10-1.49), prevalence of asthma (OR, 1.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.51), and prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.28). Findings were similar for NO2 and soot. Associations were stronger for children who had not moved since birth. Positive associations with hay fever were found in nonmovers only. No associations were found with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Conclusions: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution may cause asthma in children.},

	abstract = {We assessed the reproducibility over a 6-year period of 16 trace elements measured in toenails by comparing levels in paired specimens collected in 1982-1983 and 1988 from 127 women in the United States. The Spearman correlation coefficients for the reproducibility of toenail levels of selenium and arsenic (both known to reflect intake of these elements) were 0.48 and 0.54. Correlations for other elements ranged from 0.26 (copper) to 0.58 (zinc). In utilizing biomarkers to assess exposure in epidemiological studies of cancer and other chronic disease, random within-person variability in exposure leads to attenuation of measures of association between exposure and disease. We demonstrate the effect of such variability on odds ratios from a hypothetical case-control study. For a true odds ratio of 3.0 (for a comparison of the highest quintile versus the remaining 4 quintiles of exposure) the odds ratios which would be observed in the presence of the degree of within-person variability demonstrated in this study were 2.15 for toenail arsenic and 1.67 for toenail copper levels. Toenail concentrations of certain trace elements are useful biomarkers of exposure in which a single sample is assumed to represent long-term exposure. However, substantial attenuation in measures of association may occur.},

This study examined the association between rice consumption and urinary concentrations of arsenic in US adults, aged 20-85 years, in the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Significantly higher geometric means of creatinine-corrected urinary concentrations of total arsenic (TAs) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were found in participants who consumed rice more than twice per week, compared to the reference group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between rice consumption and urinary concentrations of TAs [odds ratio (OR) = 1.51 (1.08, 2.09)] and DMA [OR = 2.24 (1.57, 3.21)] after adjustment for demographic variables, seafood intake (the main source of organic arsenic), and source of drinking water. Furthermore, significant variations in rice consumption and urinary concentrations of arsenic were observed in different racial groups. This study demonstrated that rice consumption contributed to inorganic arsenic exposure in US adults.},

It is designed to monitor the levels of toxic chemical contaminants (pesticide residues, industrial and elemental contaminants) and essential nutrients in the US food supply. It also provides information on trends in dietary concentrations and exposures for the general population. Foods are collected from retail stores once a year from each of four geographic areas of the US and are analysed either after preparation/cooking or as ready-to-eat. The latest TDS (1991-1997) data show that arsenic (inorganic and organic, {\textgreater} or = 0.03 ppm) was found in 63 (24{\%}) of the 261-264 foods/mixed dishes analysed. The highest concentration was found in seafood, followed by rice/rice cereal, mushrooms, and poultry. Based on the United States Department of Agriculture's 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, the estimated daily total arsenic average intakes, in microgram/day, are: 2 for infants, 23 for toddlers, 20 for 6-year-old children, 13 for 10-year-old children, 15 for 14-16-year-old boys, 21 for 14-16-year-old girls, 57 for 25-30-year-old men, 28 for 25-30-year-old women, 47 for 40-45-year-old men, 37 for 40-45-year-old women, 92 for 60-65-year-old men, 72 for 60-65-year-old women, 69 for 70-year-old men, and 42 for 70-year-old women.

	abstract = {Arsenic in drinking water is an established cause of lung, bladder, and skin cancers in adults and may also cause adult kidney and liver cancers. Some evidence for these effects originated from region II of Chile, which had a period of elevated arsenic levels in drinking water, in particular from 1958 to 1970. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of early-life arsenic exposure on childhood mortality; to our knowledge, this is the first study of childhood cancer mortality and high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. In this article, we compare cancer mortality rates under the age of 20 in region II during 1950 to 2000 with those of unexposed region V, dividing subjects into those born before, during, or after the peak exposure period. Mortality from the most common childhood cancers, leukemia and brain cancer, was not increased in the exposed population. However, we found that childhood liver cancer mortality occurred at higher rates than expected. For those exposed as young children, liver cancer mortality between ages 0 and 19 was especially high: the relative risk (RR) for males born during this period was 8.9 [95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI), 1.7-45.8; P = 0.009]; for females, the corresponding RR was 14.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.6-126; P = 0.018); and for males and females pooled, the RR was 10.6 (95{\%} CI, 2.9-39.2; P {\textless} 0.001). These findings suggest that exposure to arsenic in drinking water during early childhood may result in an increase in childhood liver cancer mortality.

Marietta, Ohio, is home to the nation's longest-operating ferromanganese refinery, and community concern about exposure led to the development of the research study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: Our overall goal was to address the community's primary research question: "Does Mn affect cognitive development of children?" We evaluated the relationships between Mn exposure as measured by blood and hair Mn, along with other neurotoxicants including blood lead (Pb) and serum cotinine, and child cognition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Children 7-9 years of age were enrolled (n = 404) in the Communities Actively Researching Exposure Study (CARES) from Marietta and Cambridge, Ohio, and their surrounding communities from October 2008 through March 2013. Blood and hair were analyzed for Mn and Pb, and serum was analyzed for cotinine. We used penalized splines to assess potential nonlinear associations between biological measures and IQ subscale scores, followed by multivariable regression models with categorical variables based on quartiles of the distribution for biological measures with nonlinear associations and continuous variables for biological measures with linear associations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Geometric mean blood (n = 327) and hair Mn (n = 370) concentrations were 9.67 $\pm$ 1.27 $\mu$g/L and 416.51 $\pm$ 2.44 ng/g, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, both low and high blood and hair Mn concentrations were associated with lower Full Scale IQ and subscale scores, with significant negative associations between the highest quartile and middle two quartiles of blood Mn ($\beta$ -3.51; 95{\%} CI: -6.64, -0.38) and hair Mn ($\beta$ -3.66; 95{\%} CI: -6.9, -0.43{\%}) and Full Scale IQ.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Both low and high Mn concentrations in blood and hair were negatively associated with child IQ scores.

The dynamics of As concentration and speciation in paddy fields during dry season (boro) rice cultivation were investigated at 4 sites in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India. Three sites which were irrigated with high As groundwater had elevated As concentrations in the soils, showing a significant gradient from the irrigation inlet across the field. Arsenic concentration and speciation in soil pore water varied temporally and spatially; higher As concentrations were associated with an increasing percentage of arsenite, indicating a reductive mobilization. Concentrations of As in rice grain varied by 2-7 fold within individual fields and were poorly related with the soil As concentration. A field site employing alternating flooded-dry irrigation produced the lowest range of grain As concentration, suggesting a lower soil As availability caused by periodic aerobic conditions.},

	abstract = {Boys are heavier at birth than girls, but girls have higher fat mass at birth than boys. Insulin action may play an important role of this different distribution. Animal models have shown that female offspring are more sensitive to maternal feeding and glucose values during pregnancy and weaning than male offspring. Newborn girls have higher insulin and proinsulin concentrations and total proinsulin-to-insulin ratios in cord blood than boys, despite lighter birth weight. In a cohort of 522 newborn above 37 gestational weeks we split between the sexes and studied associations between birth weights, parental anthropometrics and fasting maternal plasma glucose and insulin levels. Boys weighed 184g more than girls, they were 1.1 cm longer and head circumference differed by 0.86 (all p values {\textless}0.01). Multiple linear regressions showed that parity, maternal body mass index, gestational age and maternal birth weight were associated with birth weight for both sexes, whereas maternal weight gain in pregnancy and maternal fasting plasma glucose at week 30-32 were significantly associated with birth weight for girls only. The effect of fasting plasma glucose on birth weight in girls was twice as high as in boys (B=162, 95{\%} CI 33.4-291, p=0.01). Paternal birth weight was significantly associated with birth weight of boys, but no such association was seen for girls. This supports the notion that there is a genetic regulation along the male line. Girls may be more sensitive to intrauterine environment and maternal glucose values, as these have a stronger influence on birth weight of girls. (copyright) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

	abstract = {In addition to cancer endpoints, arsenic exposures can also lead to non-cancerous chronic lung disease. Exposures during sensitive developmental time points can contribute to the adult disease. Using a mouse model, in utero and early postnatal exposures to arsenic (100 ppb or less in drinking water) were found to alter airway reactivity to methacholine challenge in 28 day old pups. Removal of mice from arsenic exposure 28 days after birth did not reverse the alterations in sensitivity to methacholine. In addition, adult mice exposed to similar levels of arsenic in drinking water did not show alterations. Therefore, alterations in airway reactivity were irreversible and specific to exposures during lung development. These functional changes correlated with protein and gene expression changes as well as morphological structural changes around the airways. Arsenic increased the whole lung levels of smooth muscle actin in a dose dependent manner. The level of smooth muscle mass around airways was increased with arsenic exposure, especially around airways smaller than 100 $\mu$m in diameter. This increase in smooth muscle was associated with alterations in extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin) expression. This model system demonstrates that in utero and postnatal exposure to environmentally relevant levels of arsenic can irreversibly alter pulmonary structure and function in the adults.},

The Strong Heart Study, a large epidemiological study of cardiovascular disease in American Indian communities, collected urine samples and performed medical examinations on 4549 participants over a 10 year period beginning in 1989. We used anion-exchange HPLC/ICPMS to determine concentrations of arsenic species (methylarsonate, dimethylarsinate and arsenate) in 5095 urine samples from the Strong Heart Study. We repeated the chromatography on a portion of the urine sample that had been oxidised, by addition of H2O2, to provide additional information on the presence of As(III) species and thio-arsenicals, and by difference, of arsenobetaine and other non-retained cations. Total concentrations for As, Cd, Mo, Pb, Sb, Se, U, W, and Zn were also determined in the urine samples by ICPMS. The dataset will be used to evaluate the relationships between the concentrations of urinary arsenic species and selected metals with various cardiometabolic health endpoints.

However, most health effects studies focus on single agents or consider simple two-way interaction models, in part because we lack the statistical methodology to more realistically capture the complexity of mixed exposures. We introduce Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) as a new approach to study mixtures, in which the health outcome is regressed on a flexible function of the mixture (e.g. air pollution or toxic waste) components that is specified using a kernel function. In high-dimensional settings, a novel hierarchical variable selection approach is incorporated to identify important mixture components and account for the correlated structure of the mixture. Simulation studies demonstrate the success of BKMR in estimating the exposure-response function and in identifying the individual components of the mixture responsible for health effects. We demonstrate the features of the method through epidemiology and toxicology applications.},

	abstract = {The analysis of data subject to detection limits is becoming increasingly necessary in many environmental and laboratory studies. Covariates subject to detection limits are often left censored because of a measurement device having a minimal lower limit of detection. In this paper, we propose a Monte Carlo version of the expectation-maximization algorithm to handle large number of covariates subject to detection limits in generalized linear models. We model the covariate distribution via a sequence of one-dimensional conditional distributions, and sample the covariate values using an adaptive rejection metropolis algorithm. Parameter estimation is obtained by maximization via the Monte Carlo M-step. This procedure is applied to a real dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in which values of urinary heavy metals are subject to a limit of detection. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed approach can lead to a significant reduction in variance for parameter estimates in these models, improving the power of such studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction. Infants of mothers who smoke have reduced respiratory function and are more likely to develop wheezing. Little evidence is available on the effect of in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure as opposed to postnatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. We used a previously validated non-invasive method to measure the time to peak tidal expiratory flow (tPTEF) as a proportion of expiratory time (tE) in newborn infants soon after birth to examine the effects of a family history of asthma and in-utero cigarette-smoke exposure on the infants' respiratory function. Methods. We collected respiratory-function data from 500 healthy infants of mothers taking part in the Western Australia Pregnancy Cohort Study. During behaviourally defined quiet sleep, measurements were obtained a median of 58 h (range 26-159) after the infants were born. We used uncalibrated inductance plethysmography. The uncalibrated volume signal was differentiated to flow and used to calculate respiratory rate, total inspiratory time, tE, and tPTEF. Mothers answered questionnaires on demographic, medical, and pregnancy characteristics, including smoking history. Serum cotinine measurements were available to validate self-reported smoking history in a subset of mothers (238). Results. Data suitable for analysis were obtained from 461 infants. In multivariate regression analysis, lower values of tPTEF/tE were independently associated with respiratory rate ($\beta$ coefficient per 10 breaths/min 0.018 [SE 0.005], p {\textless} 0.01), age ($\beta$ coefficient per 10 h -0.008 [0.003], p {\textless} 0.01), maternal smoking during pregnancy ({\textgreater} 10 cigarettes daily; $\beta$ coefficient -0.049 [0.022], p {\textless} 0.05), maternal hypertension during pregnancy (-0.037 [0.015], p {\textless} 0.02), and a family history of asthma (-0.028 [0.014], p {\textless} 0 05). Conclusions. In-utero smoke exposure, a family history of asthma, and maternal hypertension during pregnancy are associated with reduced respiratory function after birth. We speculate that these factors adversely affect lung development in utero.},

@article{Farzan2013,
	abstract = {Background: There is a growing body of evidence that prenatal and early childhood exposure to arsenic from drinking water can have serious long-term health implications. Objectives: Our goal was to understand the potential long-term health and disease risks associated with in utero and early life exposure to arsenic, as well as to examine parallels between findings from epidemiological studies with those from experimental animal models. Methods: We examined the current literature and identified relevant studies through PubMed by using combinations of the search terms "arsenic", "in utero", "transplacental", "prenatal" and "fetal". Discussion: Ecological studies have indicated associations between in utero and/or early life exposure to arsenic at high levels and increases in mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease. Additional data from epidemiologic studies suggest intermediate effects in early life that are related to risk of these and other outcomes in adulthood. Experimental animal studies largely support studies in humans, with strong evidence of transplacental carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis and respiratory disease, as well as insight into potential underlying mechanisms of arsenic's health effects. Conclusions: As millions worldwide are exposed to arsenic and evidence continues to support a role for in utero arsenic exposure in the development of a range of later life diseases, there is a need for more prospective studies examining arsenic's relation to early indicators of disease and at lower exposure levels. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The number of studies where nonmalignant pulmonary diseases are evaluated after occupational arsenic exposure is very few. Aims: To investigate the effects of occupational arsenic exposure on the lung by high-resolution computed tomography and pulmonary function tests. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: In this study, 256 workers with suspected respiratory occupational arsenic exposure were included, with an average age of 32.9$\pm$7.8 years and an average of 3.5$\pm$2.7 working years. Hair and urinary arsenic levels were analysed. High-resolution computed tomography and pulmonary function tests were done. Results: In workers with occupational arsenic exposure, high-resolution computed tomography showed 18.8{\%} pulmonary involvement. In pulmonary involvement, pulmonary nodule was the most frequently seen lesion (64.5{\%}). The other findings of pulmonary involvement were 18.8{\%} diffuse interstitial lung disease, 12.5{\%} bronchiectasis, and 27.1{\%} bullae-emphysema. The mean age of patients with pulmonary involvement was higher and as they smoked more. The pulmonary involvement was 5.2 times higher in patients with skin lesions because of arsenic. Diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide was significantly lower in patients with pulmonary involvement. Conclusion: Besides lung cancer, chronic occupational inhalation of arsenic exposure may cause non-malignant pulmonary findings such as bronchiectasis, pulmonary nodules and diffuse interstitial lung disease. So, in order to detect pulmonary involvement in the early stages, workers who experience occupational arsenic exposure should be followed by diffusion test and high-resolution computed tomography.},

Here, the association between diet and toenail arsenic concentrations (a long-term biomarker of exposure) was evaluated for individuals with measured household tap water arsenic. Foods known to be high in arsenic, including rice and seafood, were of particular interest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of 120 individual diet items were quantified using general linear models that also accounted for household tap water arsenic and potentially confounding factors (e.g., age, caloric intake, sex, smoking) (n = 852). As part of the analysis, we assessed whether associations between log-transformed toenail arsenic and each diet item differed between subjects with household drinking water arsenic concentrations {\textless}1 $\mu$g/L versus ≥1 $\mu$g/L.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: As expected, toenail arsenic concentrations increased with household water arsenic concentrations. Among the foods known to be high in arsenic, no clear relationship between toenail arsenic and rice consumption was detected, but there was a positive association with consumption of dark meat fish, a category that includes tuna steaks, mackerel, salmon, sardines, bluefish, and swordfish. Positive associations between toenail arsenic and consumption of white wine, beer, and Brussels sprouts were also observed; these and most other associations were not modified by exposure via water. However, consumption of two foods cooked in water, beans/lentils and cooked oatmeal, was more strongly related to toenail arsenic among those with arsenic-containing drinking water (≥1 $\mu$g/L).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that diet can be an important contributor to total arsenic exposure in U.S. populations regardless of arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Thus, dietary exposure to arsenic in the US warrants consideration as a potential health risk.},

	abstract = {In this work we have evaluated the potential carcinogenic and acutely toxic risks associated to the exposure to highly prevalent organic and inorganic contaminants through the consumption of fishery products by the Spanish population. The concentrations of 8 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 18 polychlorinated biphenils (PCBs), 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (expressed as benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalents (B[a]Peq)), and three inorganic toxic elements [arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg)] were determined in 93 samples of the most consumed species of white fish, blue fish, cephalopods and seafood species, which were acquired directly in markets and supermarkets in the Canary Islands, Spain. The chemical concentration data were combined with the pattern of consumption of these foodstuffs in order to calculate the daily intake of these contaminants, and on this basis the risk quotients for carcinogenicity and acute toxicity were determined for Spanish adults and children. Our results showed that the daily intake of OCPs, PCBs and B[a]Peq, which is associated to blue fish consumption was the highest within the fish group. The estimated intake of pollutants can be considered low or very low for the individual contaminants, when compared to reference values, except in the case of HCB and As. All the estimated intakes were below the reported Tolerable Daily Intakes. Considering the additive effects of multiple contaminants, the risk of acute toxic effects can also be considered as low or very low. However, our results reflect that the current consumption of white fish in adults and children, and also the blue fish in the case of adults, poses a moderate carcinogenic risk to Spanish consumers, mainly related to their concentrations of As. The conclusions of this research may be useful for the design of appropriate risk communication campaigns.},

We evaluated the association between several dietary factors with wheeze and atopy among children in Menorca, a Spanish Mediterranean island. A cross-sectional analysis was performed on 460 children at age 6.5 yr. Parents completed a questionnaire on the child's respiratory and allergic symptoms, and a 96-item food frequency questionnaire. Children underwent skin prick tests with six common aeroallergens. The average daily intake was relatively high for fruits (177 g) and fish (54 g), and moderate for vegetables (59 g). A high consumption ({\textgreater}40 g/day) of fruity vegetables (tomatoes, eggplants, cucumber, green beans, zucchini) was found to have beneficial effect on current wheeze [odds ratio (OR), 0.38; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.15-0.95, p {\textless} 0.05], and atopic wheeze with a significant decreasing trend when intake was increased (OR, 0.19; 95{\%} CI, 0.04-0.95, p for trend = 0.04).

@article{Keil2020,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure mixtures frequently occur in data across many domains, particularly in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiol- ogy. Various strategies have arisen to answer questions about exposure mixtures, including methods such as weighted quantile sum (wQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the mixture components. OBJECTIVES: We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the infer- ential simplicity of wQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation, a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether quantile g-computation and wQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate the effects of mixtures in a variety of common scenarios. METHODS: We examine the bias, confidence interval (CI) coverage, and bias-variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and wQS regression and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of noncausal exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and nonlinearity of expo- sure effects. RESULTS: Quantile g-computation, unlike wQS regression, allows inference on mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate CI coverage at sam- ple sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies and when the assumptions of wQS regression are not met. Further, wQS regression can mag- nify bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of the mixture are omitted from the analysis. DISCUSSION: Unlike inferential approaches that examine the effects of individual exposures while holding other exposures constant, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the effect of a mixture are essential for understanding the effects of potential public health actions that act on exposure sources. Our approach may serve to help bridge gaps between epidemiologic analysis and interventions such as regulations on industrial emissions or mining processes, dietary changes, or consumer behavioral changes that act on multiple exposures simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Current knowledge indicates that total urinary arsenic is not a suitable biomarker of exposure to toxic, i.e., inorganic, arsenic (iAs), whereas measurement of iAs and its methylated metabolites in urine using speciation analysis provides much more reliable estimates of exposure. The relative proportions of urinary iAs, monomethylarsonate (MA), and dimethylarsinate (DMA) can be used as a measure of methylation capacity, provided that there are no confounding factors such as consumption of food rich in DMA or containing As compounds metabolized to DMA. We analyzed by gradient elution anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS (high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) urine samples from 153 residents in Latium (central Italy) chronically exposed to iAs via water and food. Excluding 26 subjects that excreted high concentrations of arsenobetaine (AB) (≥50 $\mu$g As/L) due to seafood consumption, iAs and related metabolites summed up about 75 {\%} of total urinary As as measured by ICP-MS. AB and other organoarsenic compounds were detected at low concentrations in all urine samples. Considering all subjects, the sum of iAs and metabolites ranged 2-72 $\mu$g/L and relative proportions were iAs 14 {\%}, MA 13 {\%}, and DMA 72 {\%} (median values), with a wide individual variability. In addition to the above arsenocompounds, the analytical method used in this study enabled the detection of dimethylthioarsinic acid (DMTA), which was found to be present in 33 {\%} of the samples at concentrations ranging mostly from trace amounts to ∼6 $\mu$g As/L. We found that part of the certified DMA content of human urine reference material SRM 2669 was present as DMTA. Four unknown arsenicals were also detected as minor species in a small proportion of samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 IUPAC.},

	abstract = {Rice, used as staple food for half of the world population, can easily accumulate arsenic (As) into its grain, which often leads to As contamination. The health risk induced by presence of As in food depends on its release from the food matrix, i.e., its bioaccessibility. Using an in vitro gastrointestinal simulator, we incubated two types of cooked rice (total As: 0.389 and 0.314 mg/kg). Arsenic bioaccessibility and speciation changes were determined upon gastrointestinal digestion. Washing with deionized water and cooking did not result in changes of As speciation in the rice although the arsenic content dropped by 7.1-20.6{\%}. Arsenic bioaccessibility of the cooked rice in the small intestine ranged between 38 and 57{\%}. Bioaccessibility slightly increased during digestion in the simulated small intestine and decreased with time in the simulated colon. Significant speciation changes were noted in the simulated colon, with trivalent monomethylarsonate (MMA(III)) becoming an important species.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of breastfeeding and formula feeding, the age of introduction to specific foods, and the types of foods and beverages consumed by Hispanic infants and toddlers compared with similarly aged non-Hispanic infants and toddlers living in the United States.

DESIGN: Descriptive and comparative analysis of dietary recall data and responses to specific interview questions, which were collected in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study. Breastfeeding status, timing of introduction of complementary foods, percentage consuming foods from specific food groups, and the most frequently consumed fruits and vegetables by Hispanic and non-Hispanic children by age group (4-5 months, 6-11 months, 12-24 months).

SUBJECTS: A national random sample of 371 Hispanic and 2,637 non-Hispanic infants and toddlers between the ages of 4 and 24 months.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: To test for differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children in the percentage who consumed a particular food item, we calculated percentages and standard errors in SUDAAN and 95{\%} and 99{\%} confidence intervals. The most frequently consumed fruits and vegetables were determined by tallying the percentage of infants and toddlers who consumed each specific fruit or vegetable on a given day.

RESULTS: Although there were some similarities, the early flavor and food experiences of Hispanic infants were different from similarly aged non-Hispanic infants in several ways. Hispanic infants younger than 1 year of age were more likely to have ever been breastfed and those who were 4 to 5 months were more likely than non-Hispanics to be eating pureed baby foods on a daily basis. Although less likely to be eating non-infant cereals and baby food vegetables, 6- to 11-month-old Hispanics were more likely to be eating fresh fruits, fruit-flavored drinks, baby cookies, and foods such as soups, rice, and beans that are common in many Hispanic cultures. When fruits were introduced into the Hispanic child's diet, they were most commonly consumed fresh. This higher prevalence of being fed soups, rice, beans, and sweetened fruit-flavored drinks as well as tortillas was also observed among the 12- to 24-month-old toddlers.

CONCLUSIONS: Dietetics professionals should be aware of the cultural differences in the foods fed to infants and toddlers that may contribute to the development of long-term food preferences and impact on nutrition. Understanding the factors that underlie food preferences is important if we are to develop evidence-based strategies to improve children's eating habits and lower their risks factors associated with obesity and other chronic diseases.},

The final study sample consisted of 132 children from 6 to 10 years old. After controlling for confounders, an inverse association was observed between F in urine and Performance, Verbal, and Full IQ scores (beta values = -13, -15.6, -16.9, respectively). Similar results were observed for F in drinking water (beta values = -6.7, -11.2, -10.2, respectively) and As in drinking water (beta values= -4.30, -6.40, -6.15, respectively).

	abstract = {The Ria of Huelva (south-west Spain) is a highly polluted estuary as a consequence of long-term mining and industrial activities. Between 2003 and 2004, we conducted a biomonitoring study of exposure to arsenic and some heavy metals (cadmium, chromium, copper and nickel) in urine samples of a representative sample (n= 227) of children and adolescents residing in this area, and of a reference group of 196 children and adolescents living in other less industrialised areas of Andalusia (south Spain). We also assessed the determinants of the variability in urinary metals within the population of the Ria of Huelva. There were no significant differences in the concentration of metal compounds between the two groups with the exception of Cd levels, which were significantly higher in the reference group. Levels of the five metal ions in both groups were generally within the range of values reported by other biomonitoring studies for general children population, although mean Cd levels tended to be higher as compared to other European studies. Among the population of the Ria of Huelva, the main determinants of the interindividual variation in urinary metals were age, sex, area of residence, and frequency of intake of certain food items (mainly fish and shellfish). Overall, results suggest that living in the Ria of Huelva is not increasing current levels of exposure to certain metals among children and adolescents above those found in other urban areas of Andalusia. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Environmental exposure to toxic metals and metalloids is pervasive and occurs from multiple sources. The Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) is an ongoing prospective study predominantly focused on understanding health effects associated with arsenic exposure from drinking water. The goal of this project was to measure a suite of elements in urine to better understand potential exposure patterns and to identify common environmental sources of exposure among this semi-rural Bangladeshi population. Methods: In a random sample of 199 adult HEALS participants (50{\%} female), the concentrations of 15 urinary elements (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cs, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, Tl, W, Zn) were assessed by Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to assess commonalities with sociodemographic characteristics and potential sources of exposure. We used principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax normalized rotations, and hierarchical cluster analysis (CA), using Ward's method with Euclidean distances, to evaluate these relationships. Results: PCA and CA showed similar patterns, suggesting 6 principal components (PC) and 5 clusters: 1)PC: Sr-Ni-Cs/ CA: Sr-Ni-Co; 2) Pb-Tl/Pb-Tl-Se-Cs; 3) As-Mo-W/As-Mo-W; 4) Ba-Mn/Ba-Mn; 5) Cu-Zn/Cu-Zn-Cd; and 6) Cd. There was a strong significant association between the As-Mo-W PC/cluster and water arsenic levels (p {\textless} 0.001) and between the Cd PC and betel nut use (p = 0.003). The Sr-Ni-Cs PC was not related to any of the socio-demographic characteristics investigated, including smoking status and occupation. The first PC, Sr-Ni-Cs, explained 21{\%} of the variability; the third PC, As-Mo-W, explained 12.5{\%} of the variability; and the sixth PC, Cd, explained 10{\%} of the variability. Day laborers appeared to have the highest exposure. Conclusions: Groundwater and betel nut use are likely important sources of metal and metalloid exposure in this population. These findings will guide future exposure assessment research in Bangladesh and future epidemiologic research investigating the degree to which metal mixtures play a role in disease development.},

The effects of washing and cooking were also studied. The total concentration of arsenic ranged from 93 to 989 µg kg−1and its bio-accessibility ranged from 16 to 93{\%}. Cooking only changed arsenic speciation in a few cases. However, simply washing rice with arsenic-free water before cooking removed 3--43{\%} of the arsenic, resulting in all the rice tested except the most contaminated one being safe to consume by adults.},

However, data on the association between heavy metals and mortality in the general population are still limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between heavy metals and overall mortality in the general population. We enrolled 2497 participants (1001 males and 1496 females) living in southern Taiwan, and measured levels of seven heavy metals: lead (Pb) in blood and cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn) and arsenic (As) in urine. The median follow-up period was 41.8 (4--50) months, during which 40 (1.6{\%}) patients died. Compared to the participants who survived, those who died had higher urine Cd, higher urine Cu and lower urine Mn levels. Multivariate analysis showed that high urine Cd (per 1 g/L; hazard ratio [HR], 1.352; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.089--1.680; p = 0.006), high urine Cu (per 1 g/dL; HR, 1.350; 95{\%} CI, 1.151--1.583; p {\textless} 0.001), and low urine Mn (per 1 g/L; HR, 0.717; 95{\%} CI, 0.557--0.923; p = 0.010) were associated with increased overall mortality. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that high levels of urine Cd and Cu and low urine Mn level were associated with increased overall mortality in the general population.},

It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States, and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease worldwide, according to a study published by the World Bank/World Health Organization. Yet, COPD remains relatively unknown or ignored by the public as well as public health and government officials. In 1998, in an effort to bring more attention to COPD, its management, and its prevention, a committed group of scientists encouraged the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization to form the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Among the important objectives of GOLD are to increase awareness of COPD and to help the millions of people who suffer from this disease and die prematurely of it or its complications. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD, published in 2001. The present, newly revised document follows the same format as the original consensus report, but has been updated to reflect the many publications on COPD that have appeared. GOLD national leaders, a network of international experts, have initiated investigations of the causes and prevalence of COPD in their countries, and developed innovative approaches for the dissemination and implementation of COPD management guidelines. We appreciate the enormous amount of work the GOLD national leaders have done on behalf of their patients with COPD. Despite the achievements in the 5 years since the GOLD report was originally published, considerable additional work is ahead of us if we are to control this major public health problem. The GOLD initiative will continue to bring COPD to the attention of governments, public health officials, health care workers, and the general public, but a concerted effort by all involved in health care will be necessary.},

	abstract = {Objective: We sought to assess whether the metabolism of arsenic impacts a person's susceptibility to bladder cancer. Methods: Urinary methylation products were measured in subjects from Argentina (114 cases and 114 controls) and the United States (23 cases and 49 controls). Results: In Argentina, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for subjects with a high proportion of ingested arsenic excreted as monomethylarsonate ({\%}MMA) was 2.17 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-4.63) in smokers and 0.48 (95{\%} CI = 0.17-1.33) in nonsmokers. In the United States, the adjusted ORs for high {\%}MMA in subjects with arsenic intakes less than and greater than 100 $\mu$g/d were 1.20 (95{\%} CI = 0.27-5.38) and 2.70 (95{\%} CI = 0.39-18.6). Conclusions: Overall, these results are consistent with data from Taiwan suggesting that some individuals who excrete a higher proportion of ingested arsenic as MMA are more susceptible to arsenic-related cancer.

@article{Gilliland2001,
	abstract = {The effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on asthma and wheezing were investigated in 5,762 school-aged children residing in 12 Southern California communities. Responses to a self-administered questionnaire completed by parents of 4th, 7th, and 10th grade students were used to ascertain children with wheezing or physician-diagnosed asthma. Lifetime household exposures to tobacco smoke were assessed using responses about past and current smoking histories of household members and any history of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Logistic regression models were fitted to cross-sectional data to estimate the effects of in utero exposure to maternal smoking and previous and current ETS exposure on the prevalence of wheezing and physician-diagnosed asthma. In utero exposure to maternal smoking without subsequent postnatal ETS exposure was associated with increased prevalence of physician-diagnosed asthma (OR, 1.8; 95{\%} Cl, 1.1 to 2.9), asthma with current symptoms (OR, 2.3; 95{\%} Cl, 1.3 to 4.0), asthma requiring medication use in the previous 12 mo (OR, 2.1; 95{\%} Cl, 1.2 to 3.6), lifetime history of wheezing (OR, 1.8; 95{\%} Cl, 1.2 to 2.6), current wheezing with colds (OR, 2.1; 95{\%} Cl, 1.3 to 3.4) and without colds (OR, 2.5; 95{\%} Cl, 1.4 to 4.4), persistent wheezing (OR, 3.1; 95{\%} Cl, 1.6 to 6.1), wheezing with exercise (OR, 2.4; 95{\%} Cl; 1.3 to 4.3), attacks of wheezing causing shortness of breath (OR, 2.4; 95{\%} Cl, 1.3 to 4.4) or awakening at night in the previous 12 mo (OR, 3.2; 95{\%} Cl, 1.7 to 5.8), and wheezing requiring medication (OR, 2.1; 95{\%} Cl, 1.2 to 3.7) or emergency room visits during the previous year (OR, 3.4; 95{\%} Cl, 1.4 to 7.8). In contrast, current and previous ETS exposure was not associated with asthma prevalence, but was consistently associated with subcategories of wheezing. Current ETS exposure was associated with lifetime wheezing (OR, 1.3; 95{\%} Cl, 1.1 to 1.5), current wheezing with colds (OR, 1.6; 95{\%} Cl, 1.3 to 2.0) and without colds (OR, 1.5; 95{\%} Cl, 1.1 to 1.9), wheezing with exercise (OR, 1.7; 95{\%} Cl, 1.3 to 2.2), attacks of wheezing causing shortness of breath (OR, 1.6; 95{\%} Cl, 1.2 to 2.1) or awakening at night (OR, 1.5; 95{\%} Cl, 1.1 to 2.0), and wheezing requiring medication (OR, 1.4; 95{\%} Cl, 1.1 to 1.8) or emergency room visits within the previous year (OR, 1.9; 95{\%} Cl, 1.2 to 3.0). The effects of current ETS exposure on subcategories of wheezing were most pronounced among children exposed to two or more smokers and remained significant after adjusting for maternal smoking during pregnancy. We conclude that maternal smoking during pregnancy increases the occurrence of physician-diagnosed asthma and wheezing during childhood. In contrast, current ETS exposure is associated with wheezing, but not physician-diagnosed asthma. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that ETS operates as a cofactor with other insults such as intercurrent infections as a trigger of wheezing attacks, rather than as a factor that induces asthma, whereas in utero exposure acts to increase physician-diagnosed asthma.},

Total As and As species such as dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AB), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), arsenocholine (AC), tetramethylarsonium ion (Tetra), arsenosugar-glycerol (As-Gly) and inorganic As (iAs) were determined by using ICPMS and HPLC/ICPMS. In bivalves, the total As concentrations ranged from 16 to 118??mg/kg dry mass; the toxic iAs fraction contributed on average less than 0.8{\%} of the total As, while the nontoxic AB fraction formed around 58{\%}. Total As concentrations for the remaining seafood (cuttlefish, shrimp and finfish) ranged from 11 to 134??mg/kg dry mass and the iAs and AB fractions contributed on average 0.03{\%} and 81{\%} respectively of the total As. There was no significant relationship between the tissue concentrations of total As and iAs in the samples. There was also no significant relationship between As levels in seafood and geographical location or salinity of the waters from which samples were collected. Based on our results, we recommend introducing a maximum permissible level of arsenic in seafood from the Gulf based on iAs content rather than based on total As. Our analyses of cancer risks and non-cancer hazards identified non-negligible risks and the potential for hazards; the greatest risks were identified for expatriate consumers of bivalves and high-end consumers of seafood. Despite this, many uncertainties remain that would be best addressed by further analyses.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic exposure through drinking water causes cancer in adults; however,  the carcinogenic potential in children remains unknown. A recent leukemia cluster in Churchill County, Nevada, where arsenic levels in water supplies are relatively high, has prompted concern. The authors investigated the incidence of childhood cancer between 1979 and 1999 in all 17 Nevada counties, grouped by low (i.e., {\textless} 10 microg/l), medium (10-25 microg/l), and high (35-90 microg/l) population-weighted arsenic levels in public drinking water supplies. The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all childhood cancers combined were 1.00 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.94, 1.06), 0.72 (95{\%} CI = 0.43, 1.12), and 1.25 (95{\%} CI = 0.91, 1.69) for low-, medium-, and high-exposure counties, respectively. There was no relationship between arsenic levels in water and childhood leukemia (SIRs = 1.02, 0.61, and 0.86, respectively [95{\%} CIIs = 0.90, 1.15; 0.12, 1.79; and 0.37, 1.70, respectively]). For all childhood cancers, excluding leukemias, the SIRs were 0.99 (95{\%} CI = 0.92, 1.07), 0.82 (95{\%} CI = 0.42, 1.22), and 1.37 (0.92, 1.83), respectively. The excess in 5- to 9-yr-old children and 10- to 14-yr-old children was in bone cancers, and the excess in 15- to 19-yr-old young adults was primarily in lymphomas. The findings in this study are reassuring in that leukemia risks were not increased at the concentrations of arsenic in water found in this study. Nonetheless, the results raise the possibility that there are increased risks for nonleukemic childhood cancers that require confirmation in other studies, particularly those in which higher exposures are addressed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that in utero exposure to arsenic is associated with congenital defects and long-term disease consequences including cancers. Recent studies suggest that arsenic carcinogenesis results from epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation. This study aimed to investigate DNA methylation changes as a result of arsenic exposure in utero and in vitro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: For the exposure in utero study, a total of seventy-one newborns (fifty-five arsenic-exposed and sixteen unexposed newborns) were recruited. Arsenic concentrations in the drinking water were measured, and exposure in newborns was assessed by measurement of arsenic concentrations in cord blood, nails and hair by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In the in vitro study, human lymphoblasts were treated with arsenite at 0-100 $\mu$M for two, four and eight hours (short-term) and at 0, 0.5 and 1.0 $\mu$M for eight-weeks period (long-term). DNA methylation was analyzed in cord blood lymphocytes and lymphoblasts treated with arsenite in vitro. Global DNA methylation was determined as LINE-1 methylation using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and total 5-methyldeoxycytidine (5MedC) content which was determined by HPLC-MS/MS. Methylation of p53 was determined at the promoter region using methylation-specific restriction endonuclease digestion with MspI and HpaII.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results showed that arsenic-exposed newborns had significantly higher levels of arsenic in cord blood, fingernails, toenails and hair than those of the unexposed subjects and a slight increase in promoter methylation of p53 in cord blood lymphocytes which significantly correlated with arsenic accumulation in nails (p {\textless} 0.05) was observed, while LINE-1 methylation was unchanged. Short-term in vitro arsenite treatment in lymphoblastoid cells clearly demonstrated a significant global hypomethylation, determined as reduction in LINE-1 methylation and total 5-MedC content, and p53 hypermethylation (p {\textless} 0.05). However, a slight LINE-1 hypomethylation and transient p53 promoter hypermethylation were observed following long-term in vitro treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides an important finding that in utero arsenic exposure affects DNA methylation, particularly at the p53 promoter region, which may be linked to the mechanism of arsenic carcinogenesis and the observed increased incidence of cancer later in life.},

Speciation analysis was conducted using an HPLC-ICP-MS system. Ingestion exposure to arsenic and associated health risks were assessed by combining the concentration and questionnaire data both for individual participants and the subject population. Inorganic arsenic dominated both in rice and bulgur but concentrations were about an order of magnitude higher in rice (160. ??. 38. ng/g) than in bulgur. Because participants also consumed more rice than bulgur, exposures were significantly higher for rice resulting in carcinogenic risks above acceptable level for 53{\%} and 93{\%} of the participants when the in-effect and the proposed potencies were used, respectively, compared to 0{\%} and 5{\%} for bulgur. An inorganic arsenic standard for rice would be useful to lower the risks while public awareness about the relation between excessive rice consumption and health risks is built, and bulgur consumption is promoted. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In contrast, arsenobetaine, an organic arsenic compound derived from seafood intake, is considered nontoxic. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of arsenic exposure, as measured in urine, with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a representative sample of US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study in 788 adults aged 20 years or older who participated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and had urine arsenic determinations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes across intake of arsenic. RESULTS: The median urine levels of total arsenic, dimethylarsinate, and arsenobetaine were 7.1, 3.0, and 0.9 mug/L, respectively. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 7.7{\%}. After adjustment for diabetes risk factors and markers of seafood intake, participants with type 2 diabetes had a 26{\%} higher level of total arsenic (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 2.0{\%}-56.0{\%}) and a nonsignificant 10{\%} higher level of dimethylarsinate (95{\%} CI, -8.0{\%} to 33.0{\%}) than participants without type 2 diabetes, and levels of arsenobetaine were similar to those of participants without type 2 diabetes. After similar adjustment, the odds ratios for type 2 diabetes comparing participants at the 80th vs the 20th percentiles were 3.58 for the level of total arsenic (95{\%} CI, 1.18-10.83), 1.57 for dimethylarsinate (95{\%} CI, 0.89-2.76), and 0.69 for arsenobetaine (95{\%} CI, 0.33-1.48). CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for biomarkers of seafood intake, total urine arsenic was associated with increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. This finding supports the hypothesis that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water, a widespread exposure worldwide, may play a role in diabetes prevalence. Prospective studies in populations exposed to a range of inorganic arsenic levels are needed to establish whether this association is causal.},

@article{Wu2016,
	abstract = {The rational for the study was to review the literature on the toxicity and corresponding mechanisms associated with lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As), individually and as mixtures, in the environment. Heavy metals are ubiquitous and generally persist in the environment, enabling them to biomagnify in the food chain. Living systems most often interact with a cocktail of heavy metals in the environment. Heavy metal exposure to biological systems may lead to oxidation stress which may induce DNA damage, protein modification, lipid peroxidation, and others. In this review, the major mechanism associated with toxicities of individual metals was the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, toxicities were expressed through depletion of glutathione and bonding to sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Interestingly, a metal like Pb becomes toxic to organisms through the depletion of antioxidants while Cd indirectly generates ROS by its ability to replace iron and copper. ROS generated through exposure to arsenic were associated with many modes of action, and heavy metal mixtures were found to have varied effects on organisms. Many models based on concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) have been introduced to help predict toxicities and mechanisms associated with metal mixtures. An integrated model which combines CA and IA was further proposed for evaluating toxicities of non-interactive mixtures. In cases where there are molecular interactions, the toxicogenomic approach was used to predict toxicities. The high-throughput toxicogenomics combines studies in genetics, genome-scale expression, cell and tissue expression, metabolite profiling, and bioinformatics.},

@article{Davis2014a,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to toxic metals occurs through diet but few studies have comprehensively examined dietary sources of exposure in US populations. PURPOSE: Our goal was to perform a novel dietary-wide association study (DWAS) to identify specific dietary sources of lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic exposure in US children and adults. METHODS: We combined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with data from the US Department of Agriculture's Food Intakes Converted to Retail Commodities Database to examine associations between 49 different foods and environmental metal exposure. Using blood and urinary biomarkers for lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic, we compared sources of dietary exposure among children to that of adults. RESULTS: Diet accounted for more of the variation in mercury and arsenic than lead and cadmium. For instance we estimate 4.5{\%} of the variation of mercury among children and 10.5{\%} among adults is explained by diet. We identified a previously unrecognized association between rice consumption and mercury in a US study population--adjusted for other dietary sources such as seafood, an increase of 10 g/day of rice consumption was associated with a 4.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 3.6, 5.2) increase in blood mercury concentration. Associations between diet and metal exposure were similar among children and adults, and we recapitulated other known dietary sources of exposure. CONCLUSION: Utilizing this combination of data sources, this approach has the potential to identify and monitor dietary sources of metal exposure in the US population.},

@article{Vahter2009a,
	abstract = {Arsenic, which is commonly found in drinking water, is a potent toxicant, but little is known about its effects on maternal health. Arsenic's modes of action include enzyme inhibition and oxidative stress as well as immune, endocrine, and epigenetic effects. A couple of studies reported increased blood pressure and anemia during pregnancy. Susceptibility to arsenic is dependent on the biomethylation, which occurs via one-carbon metabolism. Methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid are main metabolites in urine, and elevated methylarsonic acid is considered a general risk factor. Arsenic easily passes the placenta, and a few human studies indicate a moderately increased risk of impaired fetal growth and increased fetal and infant mortality. The fetus and infant are probably partly protected by the increased methylation of arsenic during pregnancy and lactation; the infant is also protected by low arsenic excretion in breast milk. Early-life exposure may induce changes that will become apparent much later...},

	abstract = {Consumption of arsenic contaminated drinking water causes a large variety of adverse health outcomes. Body mass index (BMI), which is linked to diet, is positively associated with arsenic methylation capacity. We investigated the association between an obesity-related diet and arsenic body burden from exposure to naturally contaminated drinking water among Nova Scotia residents. We collected home drinking water and toenail clipping samples among 960 men and women aged 35 to 69. years in Nova Scotia, Canada from 2009 through 2010. We measured body composition and arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenails clipping samples and collected socio-demographic, behavioural, and dietary information via standardized questionnaires. We derived an obesity-related dietary pattern score using reduced rank regression. Across quartiles of the obesity-related dietary pattern score there were no significant differences in drinking water arsenic concentrations, but there was an inverse trend in arsenic concentrations in toenails across the dietary pattern score (P= 0.01). Compared with individuals in the first quartile of the dietary pattern score, those in the second through fourth quartiles had decreased likelihoods of high toenail arsenic (≥. 85 percentile). The corresponding odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals [CI]) were 0.81 (95{\%} CI, 0.49, 1.36), 0.57 (95{\%} CI, 0.33, 0.99), and 0.55 (95{\%} CI, 0.31, 0.98), respectively (P for trend. = 0.02). We conclude that given similar levels of naturally occurring arsenic exposure via drinking water, an obesity-related dietary pattern was associated with significantly lower arsenic concentrations in toenails. Further studies to investigate the underlining mechanisms are warranted. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Accurate and adequate quantification of trace elements are crucial in clinical research.Design: This review was to discuss the rationale of using nail trace elements as biomarkers in clinical studies.Results: For most trace elements, dietary instruments cannot appropriately capture the intakes because of the minimal amounts and wide variations in the same foods grown in different area as well as the nondietary exposures. Therefore, biomarkers may be essential in studying trace elements. Although there are notable differences among trace elements in the availability of biomarkers, increasing evidence supports that nails, particularly toenail concentrations of most trace elements, are useful biomarkers of exposure in which a single sample is assumed to represent long-term exposure.Conclusions: Compared with other potential biomarkers of trace elements, nail measurement has certain advantages in clinical research. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

The Mn concentrations in areas A, B, and C were 3.6-14.6 micrograms/l, 81.6-252.6 micrograms/l, and 1 800-2 300 micrograms/l, respectively. A random sample (62 in area A, 49 in area B, and 77 in area C) of males and females who were at least 50 y of age were submitted to a thorough neurological examination and their whole-blood Mn and hair Mn concentrations were determined. Although all areas were similar with respect to social and dietary characteristics, significant differences were observed for prevalence of chronic manganese poisoning (CMnP) symptoms and hair Mn concentration. The means (both sexes) of neurological scores were 2.7, 3.9, and 5.2, respectively, for areas A, B, and C (Kruskal-Wallis, chi 2 = 6.44, 2 df, p less than .05 for males; chi 2 = 7.8, 2 df, p less than .05 for females). Hair Mn concentrations were also significantly different, the means for which were 3.51, 4.49, and 10.99 micrograms/g dry weight, respectively (both sexes [p less than .001 for each sex separately]). These results indicate that progressive increases of Mn concentration in drinking water are associated with progressively higher prevalences of neurological signs of CMnP and Mn concentration in hair of older persons.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have suggested that preterm birth with or without subsequent chronic lung disease is associated with reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) and increased ventilation inhomogeneity in the neonatal period. We aimed to establish whether such findings are associated with the degree of prematurity, neonatal respiratory illness and disproportionate somatic growth. Methods: Multiple breath washout measurements using an ultrasonic flowmeter were obtained from 219 infants on 306 test occasions during the first few months of life, at three neonatal units in the UK and Australia. Tests were performed during unsedated sleep in clinically stable infants (assigned to four exclusive diagnostic categories: term controls, preterm controls, respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease). The determinants of neonatal lung function were assessed using multivariable, multilevel modelling. Results: After adjustment for age and body proportions, the factors gestation, intrauterine growth restriction and days of supplemental oxygen were all significantly associated with a reduced FRC. In contrast, increased ventilation inhomogeneity (elevated lung clearance index) was only significantly associated with duration of supplemental oxygen. After adjusting for continuous variables, diagnostic category made no further contribution to the models. Despite using identical techniques, unexpected inter-centre differences occurred, associated with the equipment used; these did not alter the negative association of preterm delivery and disease severity with lung function outcomes. Conclusion: Reduction in FRC is independently associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction and severity of neonatal lung disease. Determinants of lung function shortly after birth are highly complex in different disease groups.},

	abstract = {Early life factors may influence pulmonary function. We measured forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in 1985-1986 and 2, 5, and 10 years later in approximately 4,000 black and white men and women initially aged 18-30 years. We estimated the age pattern of FEV1 according to family smoking status, early diagnosis of asthma, early smoking initiation, adult asthma, and cigarette smoking. FEV1 followed a quadratic pattern from age of peak through age 40. The pattern varied by race and sex. Early smoking initiation was associated with a faster decrease in FEV1. Smoking by family members was related to early life asthma and may have contributed to faster FEV1 decrease by encouraging behaviors such as heavier smoking or earlier smoking initiation. Prevalence of smoking was 28{\%} when no family member smoked, compared with 59{\%} when four or more members smoked. The FEV1 decline was 8.5{\%} in never-smokers without asthma; 10.1{\%} in nonsmoking individuals diagnosed with asthma; and 11.1{\%} in baseline smokers who smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day. The combination of asthma and heavier smoking was synergistic (17.8{\%} decline). This study delineates an increased rate of decline in those with asthma or in those who smoke cigarettes and implicates early life exposures as contributing to the faster rate of FEV1 decline.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the scientific evidence published to date on the potential effects on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders in children exposed to arsenic, cadmium and manganese and to quantify the magnitude of the effect on neurodevelopment by pooling the results of the different studies.We conducted a systematic review of original articles from January 2000 until March 2012, that evaluate the effects on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders due to pre or post natal exposure to arsenic, cadmium and manganese in children up to 16. years of age. We also conducted a meta-analysis assessing the effects of exposure to arsenic and manganese on neurodevelopment.Forty-one articles that evaluated the effects of metallic elements on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders met the inclusion criteria: 18 examined arsenic, 6 cadmium and 17 manganese. Most studies evaluating exposure to arsenic (13 of 18) and manganese (14 of 17) reported a significant negative effect on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders. Only two studies that evaluated exposure to cadmium found an association with neurodevelopmental or behavioural disorders. The results of our meta-analysis suggest that a 50{\%} increase of arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4 decrease in the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children aged 5-15. years. Moreover a 50{\%} increase of manganese levels in hair would be associated with a decrease of 0.7 points in the IQ of children aged 6-13. years.There is evidence that relates arsenic and manganese exposure with neurodevelopmental problems in children, but there is little information on cadmium exposure. Few studies have evaluated behavioural disorders due to exposure to these compounds, and manganese is the only one for which there is more evidence of the existence of association with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Arsenic poisoning affects millions of people worldwide. Human arsenic intake from rice consumption can be substantial because rice is particularly efficient in assimilating arsenic from paddy soils, although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Here we report that two different types of transporters mediate transport of arsenite, the predominant form of arsenic in paddy soil, from the external medium to the xylem. Transporters belonging to the NIP subfamily of aquaporins in rice are permeable to arsenite but not to arsenate. Mutation in OsNIP2;1 (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake. Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly. Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1. Arsenite transport in rice roots therefore shares the same highly efficient pathway as silicon, which explains why rice is efficient in arsenic accumulation. Our results provide insight into the uptake mechanism of arsenite in rice and strategies for reducing arsenic accumulation in grain for enhanced food safety.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of health effects of exposure to mixtures is a critically important issue in human epidemiology, and increasing effort is being devoted to developing methods for this problem. A key feature of environmental mixtures is that some components can be highly correlated, raising the issues of confounding by coexposure and colinearity. A relatively unexplored topic in epidemiologic analysis of mixtures is the impact of residual confounding bias due to unmeasured or unknown variables. OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the potential amplification of such biases when correlated exposure variables are included in regression models. METHODS: We use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to describe different simple scenarios involving residual confounding. We derive expressions for the expected value of the resulting bias using linear models and multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Approaches to the analysis of mixtures that involve regressing the outcome on several exposures simultaneously can in some cases amplify rather than reduce confounding bias. DISCUSSIONS: The problem of bias amplification can worsen with stronger correlation between mixture components or when more mixture components are included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators must consider steps to minimize possible bias amplification in the design and analysis of epidemiologic studies of multiple correlated exposures. This may be particularly important when biomarkers of exposure are used.},

@article{Marsit2006a,
	abstract = {Tobacco smoking, certain occupational exposures, and exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water have been associated with the occurrence of bladder cancer. However, in these tumors the exposure-associated pattern of somatic alterations in genes in the causal pathway for disease has been poorly characterized. In particular, the mechanism by which arsenic induces bladder cancer and the effects of lower environmental levels of exposure remain uncertain. Animal and in-vitro studies have suggested that arsenic and other exposures may act through epigenetic mechanisms. We, therefore, examined, in a population-based study of human bladder cancer, the relationship between epigenetic silencing of three tumor suppressor genes, p16(INK4A), RASSF1A and PRSS3, and exposure to both tobacco and arsenic in bladder cancer. Promoter methylation of each of these genes occurred in approximately 30{\%} of bladder cancers, and both RASSF1A and PRSS3 promoter methylation were associated with advanced tumor stage (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}0.04, respectively). Arsenic exposure, measured as toenail arsenic, was associated with RASSF1A (P{\textless}0.02) and PRSS3 (P{\textless}0.1) but not p16INK4A promoter methylation, in models adjusted for stage and other factors. Cigarette smoking was associated with a {\textgreater}2-fold increased risk of promoter methylation of the p16INK4A gene only, with greater risk seen in patients with exposures more recent to disease diagnosis. These results, from human bladder tumors, add to the body of animal and in vitro evidence that suggests a role in epigenetic alterations for bladder carcinogens.},

Methods: Hair, toenail, and drinking water samples were collected from pregnant women (n = 52) at multiple time points during pregnancy and from their newborns after birth. Total arsenic was measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The association between arsenic and birth weight was investigated using linear and logistic regression models. Results: Maternal hair arsenic measured early in pregnancy was associated with decreased birth weight ($\beta$ = -193.5 $\pm$ 90.0 g, P = 0.04). Maternal hair and drinking water arsenic levels measured at first prenatal visit were significantly correlated with newborn hair arsenic level ($\rho$ = 0.32, P = 0.04 and $\rho$ = 0.31, P = 0.04).

	abstract = {Arsenic toxicity due to drinking of arsenic contaminated water has been one of the worst environmental health hazards. High levels of arsenic have been reported in different natural water sources from West Bengal for more than two decades. Groundwater contamination by arsenic and its adverse effects on the health of a big population in nine districts of West Bengal have been reported. The problems found were mainly related to skin and respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular and nervous systems. The respiratory effects are largely confined to those who had the skin lesion. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the respiratory effects of exposure to different levels of arsenic in drinking water. The water samples were collected from different tube wells and wells in the study area. Analysis of arsenic was done by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer with hydride generation system. Based on the consumption of arsenic concentrations in drinking water the populations were divided into three categories, i.e. {\textless}=50 $\mu$g/L, {\textgreater}50 - {\textless}= 150 $\mu$g/L and {\textgreater} 150 $\mu$g/L. Standard techniques of medical examination were applied to elicit signs and recorded in the pre-designed proforma. A written consent was taken from each subject for their voluntary participation in the study. 112 subjects were investigated. The respiratory effect was evaluated by measuring the pulmonary function test (PFT). Vital Capacity (VC) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) were measured by Spiro vit -SP-10 (Schiller Health Care Pvt Ltd., Switzerland) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate by Wrights Peak Flow Meter (Clement and Clarke, UK). The PFT values showed gradual decrement among the males following skin pigmentation, keratosis and arsenicosis. The respiratory function impairment among the male subjects found as restrictive type (26.41{\%}), obstructive type (3.77{\%}) and combined type (7.54{\%}) whereas in females only the restrictive type of impairment (10.16{\%}) was found. Restrictive type of impairments among the subjects increased as the concentration of arsenic in drinking water increased, in males 15.78{\%}, 29.41{\%} and 35.29{\%} and in females 4.54{\%}, 5.00{\%} and 23.52{\%} respectively. The pathophysiologic mechanism, by which ingested arsenic leads to impairments of lung function and increased respiratory symptoms, is yet to be understood and needs further investigation.},

However, variations in urinary creatinine (a measure of dilution) or serum lipid levels, if not adequately corrected for, can directly impact biomarker concentrations and bias exposure-disease association measures. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent methodological literature has considered the complex relationships between creatinine or serum lipid levels, exposure biomarkers, outcomes, and other potentially relevant factors using directed acyclic graphs and simulation studies. The optimal measures of urinary dilution and serum lipids have also been investigated. Existing evidence supports the use of covariate-adjusted standardization plus creatinine adjustment for urinary biomarkers and standardization plus serum lipid adjustment for lipophilic, serum-based biomarkers. It is unclear which urinary dilution measure is best, but all serum lipid measures performed similarly. Future research should assess methods for pooled biomarkers and for studying diseases and exposures that affect creatinine or serum lipids directly.},

On the basis of the heavy metal cations content, the potential health risk assessment calculated for a lifetime of exposure (ingestion and inhalation), based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) model, was determined as the cumulative noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risk for children and adults. The study proved that: a) the heavy metal cations content in the Korbevacka River sediments is significant; b) risk assessment indicates that while carcinogenic risk is completely insignificant, cumulative non-carcinogenic risk is significant - especially for children - as it approaches unacceptable values; and c) metal lead is the main concern in regard to negative influence on human health.},

	abstract = {Arsenic in drinking water is an established cause of lung cancer, and preliminary evidence suggests that ingested arsenic may also cause nonmalignant lung disease. Antofagasta is the second largest city in Chile and had a distinct period of very high arsenic exposure that began in 1958 and lasted 1971, when an arsenic removal plant was installed. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the long-term mortality impact of early-life arsenic exposure. In this study, we compared mortality rates in Antofagasta in the period 1989-2000 with those of the rest of Chile, focusing on subjects who were born during or just before the peak exposure period and who were 30-49 years of age at the time of death. For the birth cohort born just before the high-exposure period (1950-1957) and exposed in early childhood, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 7.0 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 5.4-8.9; p {\textless} 0.001] and the SMR for bronchiectasis was 12.4 (95{\%} CI, 3.3-31.7; p {\textless} 0.001). For those born during the high-exposure period (1958-1970) with probable exposure in utero and early childhood, the corresponding, SMR were 6.1 (95{\%} CI, 3.5-9.9; p {\textless} 0.001) for lung cancer and 46.2 (95{\%} CI, 21.1-87.7; p {\textless} 0.001) for bronchiectasis.

We measured metal levels in placenta tissue samples randomly selected from five of the seven population-based birth cohorts participating in the INMA Project, collected between 2000 and 2008. Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive and motor function was carried through the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) at the age of 4--5 years. Data on placental metal levels, MSCA scores, and relevant covariates was available for 302 children. Mn was detected in all placental samples, Cd in nearly all placentas (99{\%}) and As, Hg, and Pb in 22{\%}, 58{\%}, and 17{\%} of the placentas, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, detectable As levels were associated with decrements in global and verbal executive functions and quantitative abilities; detectable Hg was associated with lower scores on the verbal function of posterior cortex in a dose-response manner, and non-linearly related to poorer motor function and gross motor skills; and Mn levels were associated with decrement in perceptual-performance skills in a dose-response manner but with better memory span and quantitative skills. A synergistic interactive effect was found between As and Pb with respect to the general cognitive score, whereas an antagonistic interaction was found between Mn and Hg. Prenatal exposure to As and Hg may be a risk factor for cognitive and motor impairment in children, while the effects of Cd and Mn on neurodevelopment are less clear. Future studies should examine combined and interactive effects of exposure to multiple metals during vulnerable periods of brain development prospectively.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns for arsenic exposure are not limited to toxic waste sites and massive poisoning events. Chronic exposure continues to be a major public health problem worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of persons.Objectives: We reviewed recent information on worldwide concerns for arsenic exposures and public health to heighten awareness of the current scope of arsenic exposure and health outcomes and the importance of reducing exposure, particularly during pregnancy and early life.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We synthesized the large body of current research pertaining to arsenic exposure and health outcomes with an emphasis on recent publications.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Locations of high arsenic exposure via drinking water span from Bangladesh, Chile, and Taiwan to the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level (MCL) in drinking water is 10 µg/L; however, concentrations of {\textgreater} 3,000 µg/L have been found in wells in the United States. In addition, exposure through diet is of growing concern. Knowledge of the scope of arsenic-associated health effects has broadened; arsenic leaves essentially no bodily system untouched. Arsenic is a known carcinogen associated with skin, lung, bladder, kidney, and liver cancer. Dermatological, developmental, neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular, immunological, and endocrine effects are also evident. Most remarkably, early-life exposure may be related to increased risks for several types of cancer and other diseases during adulthood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data call for heightened awareness of arsenic-related pathologies in broader contexts than previously perceived. Testing foods and drinking water for arsenic, including individual private wells, should be a top priority to reduce exposure, particularly for pregnant women and children, given the potential for life-long effects of developmental exposure.},

	abstract = {Objective: The mechanism of arsenic detoxification in humans remains unclear. Data are especially lacking for low-level arsenic exposure. We hypothesize that arsenic methylation ability, defined as the ratios of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V))/inorganic arsenic (primary arsenic methylation index, PMI) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V))/MMA(V) (secondary arsenic methylation index, SMI), may modify the association between cumulative arsenic exposure (CAE, mg/L-year) and the risk of bladder cancer. In this study we investigated the relationship among arsenic methylation ability, CAE, and the risk of bladder cancer in a hospital-based case-control study in southwestern Taiwan. Methods: From January 1996 to December 1999 we identified 49 patients with newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer at the National Cheng-Kung University (NCKU) Medical Center; controls consisted of 224 fracture and cataract patients selected from the same medical center. The levels of four urinary arsenic species: arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), MMA(V), and DMA(V)) were determined in all subjects by using the high-performance liquid chromatography hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HPLC-HGAAS). CAE was estimated by using published data collected in a survey from 1974 to 1976. Results: Compared to a CAE ≦ 2 mg/L-year, CAE {\textgreater} 12 mg/L-year was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (multivariate odds ratio (OR) 4.23, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.12-16.01), in the setting of a low SMI (≦4.8). Compared to women, smoking men (OR 6.23, 95{\%} CI 1.88-20.62) and non-smoking men (OR 3.25, 95{\%} CI 0.95-11.06) had higher risks of bladder cancer. Given the same level of PMI, smoking men (OR 9.80, 95{\%} CI 2.40-40.10) and non-smoking men (OR 4.45, 95{\%} CI 1.00-19.84) had a higher risk of bladder cancer when compared to women. With the same level of SMI, both smoking men (OR 6.28, 95{\%} CI 1.76-22.39) and non-smoking men (OR 3.31, 95{\%} CI 0.84-12.97) had a higher risk of bladder cancer when compared to women. Conclusions: Subjects with low SMI have a substantially increased risk of bladder cancer, especially when combined with high CAE levels.},

Exposure was also assessed considering the season during which the third trimester of pregnancy occurred.Significant changes in consumptions during pregnancy and between seasons were associated with differences in exposures for some substances.Some contaminant exposures appeared to be of health concern. Margins of exposure to acrylamide (635 to 1094 for mean), inorganic arsenic, lead, and BDE-99 (≤100) were too low to exclude all risks. For NDL-PCBs, T-2 and HT-2 toxins, and deoxynivalenol, significant exceedings of toxicological reference values were found before pregnancy, but there was no significant exceeding in the third trimester. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A pilot dietary experiment was conducted over 10 days to evaluate whether a simple yet often underutilized approach of constructing mass balance of arsenic metabolites can be used to assess in vivo bioaccessibility of arsenic in cooked rice. Two volunteers were involved in this study. The quantity of drinking water, food and urine samples, together with arsenic concentration and speciation of these samples was monitored to construct a mass balance of arsenic intake and excretion. In the first five days, the two volunteers on a wheat diet had an average arsenic daily intake of 15.4+/-2.6microg and 9.6+/-0.7microg, respectively. In the next five days, these volunteers switched to a rice diet, increasing the average arsenic daily intake to 36.4+/-2.8microg and 34.1+/-7.7microg, respectively. Daily excretion of urinary arsenic, mostly as dimethylarsenic acid (DMA), doubled from 9.8+/-0.3microg to 21.0+/-3.0microg, and from 6.5+/-0.8microg to 11.6+/-4.5microg, respectively. The percentage of ingested arsenic excreted in urine remained constant at approximately 58{\%} for one volunteer before and after the rice diet, and was approximately 69{\%} for another. Mass balance established during a controlled dietary experiment over 10 days is shown to be a useful approach to evaluate in vivo bioaccessibility and metabolism of arsenic uptake from diet and is applicable to study with more subjects.},

@article{Chernoff2020,
	abstract = {Approximately 140 million people worldwide are exposed to inorganic arsenic through contaminated drinking water. Chronic exposure increases risk for cancers as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic diseases. Arsenic metabolism involves the AS3MT (arsenic methyltransferase) gene, and arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME, measured as relative concentrations of arsenic metabolites in urine) varies among individuals. Inherited genetic variation in the 10q24.32 region, containing AS3MT, influences AME, but the mechanisms remain unclear. To better understand these mechanisms, we use tissue-specific expression data from GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression project) to identify cis-eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) for AS3MT and other nearby genes. We combined these data with results from a genome-wide association study of AME using ``co-localization analysis,'' to determine if 10q24.32 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) affecting AME also effect expression of AS3MT or nearby genes. These analyses identified cis-eQTLs for AS3MT in 38 tissue types. Co-localization results suggest that the casual variant represented by AME lead SNP rs4919690 impacts expression of AS3MT in 13 tissue types ({\textgreater}80{\%} probability). Our results suggest this causal SNP also regulates/co-regulates expression of nearby genes: BORCS7 (43 tissues), NT5C2 (2 tissues), CYP17A1-AS1 (1 tissue), and RP11-724N1.1 (1 tissue). The rs4919690 allele associated with decreased AME is associated with decreased expression of AS3MT (and other co-regulated genes). Our study provides a potential biological mechanism for the association between 10q24.32 variation and AME and suggests that the causal variant, represented by rs4919690, may impact AME (as measured in urine) through its effects on arsenic metabolism occurring in multiple tissue types.},

Our findings show differences in transitional-metal levels between polished and unpolished rice and geographical variation in As and selenium (Se) between rice processed in California and the South Central U.S. The mean and median As grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.30 and 0.27 mimcrog As g(-1), respectively, for 107 samples. Levels for California were 41{\%} lower than the South Central U.S., with a mean of 0.17 microg As g(-1) and a median of 0.16 microg As g(-1) for 27 samples. The mean and median Se grain levels for the South Central U.S. were 0.19 microg Se g(-1). Californian rice levels were lower, averaging only 0.08 and 0.06 microg Se g(-1) for mean and median values, respectively. The difference between the two regions was found to be significant for As and Se (General Linear Model (GLM): As p {\textless} 0.001; Se p {\textless} 0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed in As or Se levels between polished and unpolished rice (GLM: As p= 0.213; Se p= 0.113). No significant differences in grain levels of manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), or zinc (Zn) were observed between California and the South Central U.S. Modeling arsenic intake for the U.S. population based on this survey shows that for certain groups (namely Hispanics, Asians, sufferers of Celiac disease, and infants) dietary exposure to inorganic As from elevated levels in rice potentially exceeds the maximum intake of As from drinking water (based on consumption of 1 L of 0.01 mg L(-1) In. As) and Californian state exposure limits. Further studies on the transformation of As in soil, grain As bioavailability in the human gastrointestinal tract, and grain elemental speciation trends are critical.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic from drinking water has been associated with malignant and  nonmalignant respiratory illnesses. The association with nonmalignant respiratory illnesses has not been well established because the assessments of respiratory symptoms may be influenced by recall bias or interviewer bias because participants had visible skin lesions. OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship of the serum level of Clara cell protein CC16--a novel biomarker for respiratory illnesses--with well As, total urinary As, and urinary As methylation indices. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in nonsmoking individuals (n = 241) selected from a large cohort with a wide range of As exposure (0.1-761 microg/L) from drinking water in Bangladesh. Total urinary As, urinary As metabolites, and serum CC16 were measured in urine and serum samples collected at baseline of the parent cohort study. RESULTS: We observed an inverse association between urinary As and serum CC16 among persons with skin lesions (beta = -0.13, p = 0.01). We also observed a positive association between secondary methylation index in urinary As and CC16 levels (beta = 0.12, p = 0.05) in the overall study population; the association was stronger among people without skin lesions (beta = 0.18, p = 0.04), indicating that increased methylation capability may be protective against As-induced respiratory damage. In a subsample of study participants undergoing spirometric measures (n = 31), we observed inverse associations between urinary As and predictive FEV(1) (forced expiratory volume measured in 1 sec) (r = -0.37; FEV(1)/forced vital capacity ratio and primary methylation index (r = -0.42, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that serum CC16 may be a useful biomarker of epithelial lung damage in individuals with arsenical skin lesions. Also, we observed the deleterious respiratory effects of As exposure at concentrations lower than reported in earlier studies.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a metalloid that may represent a serious environmental threat, due to its wide abundance and the high toxicity particularly of its inorganic forms. The use of arsenic-contaminated groundwater for irrigation purposes in crop fields elevates the arsenic concentration in topsoil and its phytoavailability for crops. The transfer of arsenic through the crops-soil-water system is one of the more important pathways of human exposure. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, maize (Zea mays L.) is the most cultivated cereal in the world. This cereal constitutes a staple food for humans in the most of the developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Thus, this review summarizes the existing literature concerning the conditions involved in agricultural soil that leads to As influx into maize crops and the uptake mechanisms, metabolism and phytotoxicity of As in corn plants. Additionally, the studies of the As accumulation in raw corn grain and corn food are summarized, and the As biotransfer into the human diet is highlighted. Due to high As levels found in editable plant part for livestock and humans, the As uptake by corn crop through water-soil-maize system may represent an important pathway of As exposure in countries with high maize consumption. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This study aimed to determine the degree of severity of As exposure from drinking water in peri-urban Moyna and Ardebok villages, West Bengal, India. Arsenic concentrations in hair, nail and urine samp les of the individuals were determined. Arsenical dermatosis, keratosis and melanosis were investigated through medical evaluation. We have evaluated the association between As exposure from drinking water, and keratosis and melanosis outcomes. The results showed that 82.7 {\%} of the sampled tube wells contain As concentrations above 10 $\mu$g/L, while 57.7 {\%} contain As concentrations above 50 $\mu$g/L. The hair, nail and urine As concentrations were positively correlated with As concentrations in drinking water. In our study population, we observed a strong association between As concentrations ranging 51-99 $\mu$g/L and keratosis and melanosis outcomes, although the probability decreases at higher concentration ranges perhaps due to switching away from the use of As-contaminated tube wells for drinking and cooking purposes. High As concentrations in hair, nail and urine were observed to be associated with the age of the study population. The level of As concentrations in hair, nail and urine samples of the study population indicated the degree of severity of As exposure in the study region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Results regarding the association between mercury exposure and anthropometry at birth, gestational length and placental weight are inconsistent, as is the role of seafood intake in these associations. 

OBJECTIVE
We assessed whether prenatal mercury exposure is associated with anthropometry at birth, placental weight and gestational length in a population with a relatively high exposure to mercury from seafood consumption. 

METHODS
Total mercury (T--Hg) was determined in cord blood from 1869 newborns with birth outcome measures, within the Spanish multicenter INMA cohort from 2004 to 2008. We adjusted cohort specific linear and Cox regression models to evaluate the association between T--Hg and birth anthropometry (weight, length, and head circumference), placental weight and gestational length. Non-spontaneous labor was taken to be censoring in the survival analysis. Final estimates were obtained using meta-analysis. 

RESULTS
Geometric mean T--Hg was 8.2$\mu$g/L. A doubling of T--Hg was associated with a 7.7g decrease in placental weight (95{\%} CI: −13.6, −1.8) and marginally with head circumference (beta: −0.052cm, 95{\%} CI: −0.109, 0.005). T--Hg was also inversely related to weight and length, although with weaker estimates. Mercury exposure was not associated with the length of gestation. The inverse relation between T--Hg and growth was enhanced when the intake of different seafood groups was adjusted for in the models. 

CONCLUSIONS
Prenatal mercury exposure may be associated with reduced placental and fetal growth. Confounding by fish intake should be considered when assessing these relationships.},

	abstract = {Arsenic contamination of rice plants by arsenic-polluted irrigation groundwater could result in high arsenic concentrations in cooked rice. The main objective of the study was to estimate the total and inorganic arsenic intakes in a rural population of West Bengal, India, through both drinking water and cooked rice. Simulated cooking of rice with different levels of arsenic species in the cooking water was carried out. The presence of arsenic in the cooking water was provided by four arsenic species (arsenite, arsenate, methylarsonate or dimethylarsinate) and at three total arsenic concentrations (50, 250 or 500 microg l(-1)). The results show that the arsenic concentration in cooked rice is always higher than that in raw rice and range from 227 to 1642 microg kg(-1). The cooking process did not change the arsenic speciation in rice. Cooked rice contributed a mean of 41{\%} to the daily intake of inorganic arsenic. The daily inorganic arsenic intakes for water plus rice were 229, 1024 and 2000 microg day(-1) for initial arsenic concentrations in the cooking water of 50, 250 and 500 microg arsenic l(-1), respectively, compared with the tolerable daily intake which is 150 microg day(-1).},

@article{Baris2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for at least five decades. Incidence rates in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont are about 20{\%} higher than the United States overall. We explored reasons for this excess, focusing on arsenic in drinking water from private wells, which are particularly prevalent in the region. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study in these three states, 1213 bladder cancer case patients and 1418 control subjects provided information on suspected risk factors. Log transformed arsenic concentrations were estimated by linear regression based on measurements in water samples from current and past homes. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Bladder cancer risk increased with increasing water intake (Ptrend = .003). This trend was statistically significant among participants with a history of private well use (Ptrend = .01). Among private well users, this trend was apparent if well water was derived exclusively from shallow dug wells (which are vulnerable to contamination from manmade sources, Ptrend = .002) but not if well water was supplied only by deeper drilled wells (Ptrend = .48). If dug wells were used pre-1960, when arsenical pesticides were widely used in the region, heavier water consumers ({\textgreater}2.2 L/day) had double the risk of light users ({\textless}1.1 L/day, Ptrend = .01). Among all participants, cumulative arsenic exposure from all water sources, lagged 40 years, yielded a positive risk gradient (Ptrend = .004); among the highest-exposed participants (97.5th percentile), risk was twice that of the lowest-exposure quartile (odds ratio = 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.29 to 3.89). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an association between low-to-moderate levels of arsenic in drinking water and bladder cancer risk in New England. In addition, historical consumption of water from private wells, particularly dug wells in an era when arsenical pesticides were widely used, was associated with increased bladder cancer risk and may have contributed to the New England excess.},

@article{Hernandez2017,
	abstract = {Little is known about the potential adverse effects from longterm exposure to complex mixtures at low doses, close to health-based reference values. Traditional chemical-specific risk assessment based on animal testing may be insufficient and the lack of toxicological studies on chemical mixtures remains a major regulatory challenge. Hence, new methodologies on cumulative risk assessment are being developed but still present major limitations. Evaluation of chemical mixture effects requires an integrated and systematic approach and close collaboration across different scientific fields, particularly toxicology, epidemiology, exposure science, risk assessment and statistics for a proper integration of data from all these disciplines. Well designed and conducted epidemiological studies can take advantage of this new paradigm and can provide insight to support the correlation between humans low-dose exposures and diseases, thus avoiding the uncertainty associated with extrapolation across species. In this regard, human epidemiology studies may play a significant role in the new vision of toxicity testing. However, this type of information has not been fully considered in risk assessment, mainly due to the inherent limitations of epidemiologic studies. An integrated approach of in vivo, in vitro and in silico data, together with systematic reviews or meta-analysis of high quality epidemiological studies will improve the robustness of risk assessment of chemical mixtures and will provide a stronger basis for regulatory decisions. The ultimate goal is that experimental and mechanistic data can lend support and biological plausibility to the human epidemiological observations.},

Children are particularly vulnerable to adverse health effects from arsenic exposure. Despite AAP Guidelines, approaches to engage pediatric clinicians in promoting private well testing have not been previously described. We sought to determine the most effective practice approaches to achieve successful well water testing in routine pediatric care. 12 primary care clinics were block randomized to one of four study arms. Two intervention variables were assessed: (1) test results access (parent only vs. parent and clinic) and (2) follow up approaches (yes/no). Parents of children under 12 months using a private well were eligible. Prepaid water tests were provided. Primary outcome was parental water test completion. Eleven clinics successfully implemented processes identifying well users. 240 testing kits were dispensed. Completion rates averaged 29{\%} (range 10 to 61{\%}). The study arm with both clinic results access and staff follow up system was 2.3 times more likely to achieve test completion than other arms (95{\%} CI 1.12-4.86, p = .03). Kit distribution by clinicians versus nursing staff, irrespective of study arm, had 2.4 times greater completion (95{\%} CI 1.13-5.11, p = .02). Systematic drinking water source screening can be improved in pediatric care. Higher testing completion was found in practices randomized to reminders and structured follow up versus single visit discussion, but clinician involvement was the most predictive factor.},

	abstract = {Plants absorb a number of elements from soil, some of which have no known biological function and some are known to be toxic at low concentrations. As plants constitute the foundation of the food chain, some concerns have been raised about the possibility of toxic concentrations of certain elements being transported from plants to higher strata of the food chain. Special attention has been given to the uptake and biotransformation mechanisms occurring in plants and its role in bioaccumulation and impact on consumers, especially human beings. While this review draws particular attention to metal accumulation in edible plants, researched studies of certain wild plants and their consumers are included. Furthermore, this review focuses on plant uptake of the toxic elements arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, and lead and their possible transfer to the food chain. These elements were selected because they are well-established as being toxic for living systems and their effects in humans have been widely documented. Arsenic is known to promote cancer of the bladder, lung, and skin and can be acquired, for example, through the consumption of As-contaminated rice. Cadmium can attack kidney, liver, bone, and it also affects the female reproduction system. Cadmium also can be found in rice. Chromium can produce cancer, and humans can be exposed through smoking and eating Cr-laden vegetables. Lead and mercury are well known neurotoxins that can be consumed via seafood, vegetables and rice. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Arsenic does not directly damage DNA, but may act as a carcinogen through inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms, leading indirectly to increased mutations from other DNA damaging agents. The molecular mechanism underlying arsenic inhibition of nucleotide excision repair after UV irradiation (Hartwig et al., Carcinogenesis 1997;18:399-405) is unknown, but could be due to decreased expression of critical genes involved in nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing expression of repair genes and arsenic exposure in a subset of 16 individuals enrolled in a population based case-control study investigating arsenic exposure and cancer risk in New Hampshire. Toenail arsenic levels were inversely correlated with expression of critical members of the nucleotide excision repair complex, ERCC1 (r(2) = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.0001), XPF (r(2) = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.002), and XPB (r(2) = 0.75, p {\textless} 0.0001). The internal dose marker, toenail arsenic level, was more strongly associated with changes in expression of these genes than drinking water arsenic concentration. Our findings, based on human exposure to arsenic in a US population, show an association between biomarkers of arsenic exposure and expression of DNA repair genes. Although our findings need verification in a larger study group, they are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of DNA repair capacity is a potential mechanism for the co-carcinogenic activity of arsenic.},

	abstract = {Background: The association of long-term inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure through drinking water with risk of liver cancer mortality remains controversial. Therefore, we reviewed and quantitatively summarized the evidence from observational studies with a meta-analysis. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure through May 2014 and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles. Studies that reported standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CIs) for the association of iAs in drinking water with liver cancer were eligible. The random effect model was adopted as the pooling method to generate summary effect estimates (meta-SMRs). Results: Of the 4851 articles identified through searching databases, 7 articles including 12 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-SMR with 95{\%} CI of liver cancer for the highest versus lowest category of iAs exposure level in drinking water was 1.80 (1.61 to 2.02). Furthermore, an increased risk of liver cancer mortality was found in both females [1.80 (1.45 to 2.24)] and males [1.84 (1.56 to 2.16)]. In subgroup analysis, the meta-SMRs were 1.93 (1.72 to 2.15) for cohort studies, 1.60 (1.22 to 2.10) for ecological studies, 1.93 (1.72 to 2.15) for studies conducted in Asia, and 1.60 (1.22 to 2.10) for studies conducted in South America, respectively. After removing the 3 studies conducted by Smith et al. (having two studies separately for males and females) and Chen et al. that had a strong effect on heterogeneity, a significant association was also found [1.85 (1.72 to 1.99)]. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that long-term iAs exposure through drinking water increases the risk of liver cancer mortality.},

This study examines As exposure and bioaccumulation from drinking water by monitoring human keratin in the form of toenails from exposed populations. Groundwater samples from drinking water wells (n=34) were collected along with toenail samples (n=58) from local communities and were analyzed for trace metals including As by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Of the total number of wells tested, 53{\%} had As level above the WHO maximum contamination level of 10 p.p.b. Arsenic in toenails was significantly correlated to corresponding drinking water (r=0.72; R(2)=0.52; P{\textless}0.001). This correlation improves for drinking water with As concentrations above 2 p.p.b. (r=0.74; R(2)=0.54; P{\textless}0.001). Male minors ({\textless}18 years old) were found to have greater nail-As concentrations compared with adults consuming equal amounts of As (P{\textless}0.05). Estimated As dose specifically from drinking water sources was also associated with nail concentrations (P{\textless}0.01). We suggest that As measurement in nails could be a reliable method for detecting As exposure in residents living in rural areas.},

Exposure to arsenic in early life has been shown to increase the rate of respiratory infections during infancy, reduce childhood lung function, and increase the rates of bronchiectasis in early adulthood. Objective: We aimed to determine if early life exposure to arsenic exacerbates the response to early life influenza infection in mice. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to arsenic in utero and throughout postnatal life. At 1 week of age, a subgroup of mice were infected with influenza A. We then assessed the acute and long-term effects of arsenic exposure on viral clearance, inflammation, lung structure, and lung function. Results: Early life arsenic exposure reduced the clearance of and exacerbated the inflammatory response to influenza A, and resulted in acute and long-term changes in lung mechanics and airway structure. Conclusions: Increased susceptibility to respiratory infections combined with exaggerated inflammatory responses throughout early life may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis in arsenic-exposed populations.},

	abstract = {While the impact of arsenic in irrigated agriculture has become a major environmental concern in Bangladesh, to date there is still a limited understanding of arsenic in Bangladeshi paddy soils at a landscape level. A soil survey was conducted across ten different physiographic regions of Bangladesh, which encompassed six types of geomorphology (Bil, Brahmaputra floodplain, Ganges floodplain, Meghna floodplain, Karatoya-Bangali floodplain and Pleistocene terrace). A total of 1209 paddy soils and 235 matched non-paddy soils were collected. The source of irrigation water (groundwater and surface water) was also recorded. The concentrations of arsenic and sixteen other elements were determined in the soil samples. The concentration of arsenic was higher in paddy soils compared to non-paddy soils, with soils irrigated with groundwater being higher in arsenic than those irrigated with surface water. There was a clear difference between the Holocene floodplains and the Pleistocene terraces, with Holocene floodplain soils being higher in arsenic and other elements. The results suggest that arsenic is most likely associated with less well weathered/leached soils, suggesting it is either due to the geological newness of Holocene sediments or differences between the sources of sediments, which gives rise to the arsenic problems in Bangladeshi soils.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Manganese, lead, arsenic and mercury are common neurotoxic metals in the environment. Nonetheless, the relationship between prenatal exposure to low doses of neurotoxic metals and neurodevelopment in children is not clear. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between in utero exposure to environmental neurotoxic metals and neurodevelopment at 2 years of age. Methods: The population of this study came from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study. We included 230 pairs of non-smoking mothers without any occupational exposure and their singleton full-term children. The information about exposure during pregnancy was obtained using a structured questionnaire, and the manganese, lead, arsenic and mercury levels in umbilical cord blood samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We used the Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT) to evaluate the developmental status of each child at 2 years of age, and we examined the association of in utero exposure to environmental metals and neurodevelopment using linear regression models. Results: The median concentrations of manganese, lead, arsenic and mercury in the cord blood samples in this study were 47.90. $\mu$g/L (range, 17.88-106.85. $\mu$g/L), 11.41. $\mu$g/L (range 0.16-43.22. $\mu$g/L), 4.05. $\mu$g/L (range, 1.50-12.88. $\mu$g/L) and 12.17. $\mu$g/L (range, 1.53-64.87. $\mu$g/L), respectively. After adjusting for maternal age, infant gender, environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and after delivery, Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory results, and arsenic and mercury levels in cord blood, we found that manganese and lead levels above the 75th percentile had a significant adverse association with the overall (. $\beta$=-7.03, SE=2.65, P=0.0085), cognitive (. $\beta$=-8.19, SE=3.17, P=0.0105), and language quotients (. $\beta$=-6.81, SE=2.73, P=0.0133) of the CDIIT. Conclusions: In utero exposure to environmental manganese and lead may have an adverse association with neurodevelopment at 2 years of age, and there is an interaction effect between the manganese and lead levels in the cord blood that could aggravate the effect. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Cases of cutaneous melanoma and controls were enrolled in a New Mexico population-based study; subjects were administered questionnaires concerning ultraviolet (UV) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure. Historical iAs exposure was estimated. UV exposure estimates were also derived using geospatial methods. Drinking water samples were collected for iAs analysis. Blood samples were collected for DNA repair (Comet) and DNA repair gene polymorphism assays. Arsenic concentrations were determined in urine and toenail samples. UV exposures during the previous 90 days did not vary significantly between cases and controls. Mean ($\pm$SD) current home iAs drinking water was not significantly different for cases and controls [3.98 $\mu$g/L ($\pm$3.67) vs. 3.47 $\mu$g/L ($\pm$2.40)]. iAs exposure showed no effect on DNA repair or association with melanoma. Results did not corroborate a previously reported association between toenail As and melanoma risk. Arsenic biomarkers in urine and toenail were highly significantly correlated with iAs in drinking water. A UV-DNA repair interaction for UV exposure over the previous 7-90 days was shown; cases had higher DNA damage than controls at low UV values. This novel finding suggests that melanoma cases may be more sensitive to low-level UV exposure than are controls. A UV-APEX1 interaction was shown. Subjects with the homozygous rare APEX1 DNA repair gene allele had a higher risk of early melanoma diagnosis at low UV exposure compared with those with the homozygous wild type or the heterozygote. Notably, a UV-arsenic interaction on inhibition of DNA repair was not observed at iAs drinking water concentrations below 10 ppb ($\mu$g/L).},

@article{Stein1997,
	abstract = {Background - Follow up studies in Britain have shown that low rates of fetal growth are followed by reduced lung function in adult life, independent of smoking and social class. It is suggested that fetal adaptations to undernutrition in utero result in permanent changes in lung structure, which in turn lead to chronic airflow obstruction. India has high rates of intrauterine growth retardation, but no study has examined the association between fetal growth and adult lung function in Indian people. We have related size at birth to lung function in an urban Indian population aged 38- 59 years. Methods - Two hundred and eighty six men and women born in one hospital in Mysore City, South India, during 1934-1953 were traced by a house-to-house survey of the city. Their mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured using a turbine spirometer. These measurements were linked to their size at birth, recorded at the time. Results - In both men and women mean FEV1 fell with decreasing birthweight. Adjusted for age and height, it fell by 0.09 litres with each pound (454g) decrease in birthweight in men (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.16) and by 0.06 (95{\%} CI -0.01 to 0.13) in women. Likewise, mean FVC fell by 0.11 litres (95{\%} CI 0.02 to 0.19) with each pound decrease in birth- weight in men, and by 0.08 litres (95{\%} CI 0.002 to 0.16) in women. FEV1 and FVC were lower in men who smoked, but the associations with size at birth were independent of smoking. Small head circumference at birth was associated with a low FEV1/FVC ratio in men which may reflect restriction in airway growth in early gestation. Conclusion - This is further evidence that adult lung function is 'programmed' in fetal life. Smoking may be particularly detrimental to the lung function of populations already disadvantaged by poor rates of fetal growth.},

We measured arsenic concentrations of the toenails using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, we examined the association of arsenic levels with lifestyles and dietary habits, including the consumption of fish, seaweed, and rice. The mean toenail arsenic level was 0.41 ppm (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.36-0.47), which was about 3-fold higher than those observed in other populations of mainland Kagoshima. Arsenic levels were elevated among current smokers (mean = 0.65; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.32-1.29) when compared with non-smokers (mean = 0.40; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.34-0.46), and among the residents consuming 4 bowls or more, of rice every day (mean = 1.97; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.25-15.75) when compared to residents consuming 3 bowls or less (mean = 0.39; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.34-0.45). Sex, age, alcohol intake, fish consumption, or seaweed consumption was not associated with toenail arsenic concentration.

Significant amounts of unknown metabolites were also detected. The excretion patterns of arsenic from individuals were generally similar except for two subjects. One of whom excreted high amounts of arsenobetaine even though no arsenic-rich food was eaten for 3 days before the experiment.

	abstract = {Interest in the contribution of changes in lung development during early life to subsequent respiratory morbidity is increasing. Most evidence of an association between adverse intrauterine factors and structural effects on the developing lung is from animal studies. Such evidence has been augmented by epidemiological studies showing associations between insults to the developing lung during prenatal and early postnatal life and adult respiratory morbidity or reduced lung function, and by physiological studies that have elucidated mechanisms underlying these associations. The true effect of early insults on subsequent respiratory morbidity can be understood only if the many prenatal and postnatal factors that can affect lung development are taken into account. Adverse factors affecting lung development during fetal life and early childhood reduce the attainment of maximum lung function and accelerate lung function decline in adulthood, initiating or worsening morbidity in susceptible individuals. In this Review, we focus on factors that adversely affect lung development in utero and during the first 5 years after birth, thereby predisposing individuals to reduced lung function and increased respiratory morbidity throughout life. We focus particularly on asthma and COPD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Early childhood inorganic arsenic (i-As) exposure is of particular concern since it may adversely impact on lifetime health outcomes. Infants' urinary arsenic (As) metabolites were analysed in 79 infants by inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometric detection (ICICP- MS) to evaluate i-As exposure pre-And post-weaning. Levels of i-As in rice-based weaning and infants' foods were also determined to relate to urinary As levels. Higher As levels, especially of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), were found in urine from formula fed infants compared to those breastfed. Urine from infants post-weaning consuming rice-products resulted in higher urinary MMA and DMA compared to the paired pre-weaning urine samples. The European Union (EU) has regulated i-As in rice since 1st January 2016. Comparing infants' rice-based foods before and after this date, little change was found. Nearly of the rice-based products specifically marketed for infants and young children contained i-As over the 0.1 mg/kg EU limit. Efforts should be made to provide low i-As rice and rice-based products consumed by infants and young children that do not exceed the maximum i-As level to protect this vulnerable subpopulation.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of a 61-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire used in a large prospective study among women. This form was administered twice to 173 participants at an interval of approximately one year (1980-1981), and four one-week diet records for each subject were collected during that period. Intraclass correlation coefficients for nutrient intakes estimated by the one-week diet records (range = 0.41 for total vitamin A without supplements to 0.79 for vitamin B6 with supplements) were similar to those computed from the questionnaire (range = 0.49 for total vitamin A without supplements to 0.71 for sucrose), indicating that these methods were generally comparable with respect to reproducibility. With the exception of sucrose and total carbohydrate, nutrient intakes from the diet records tended to correlate more strongly with those computed from the questionnaire after adjustment for total caloric intake. Correlation coefficients between the mean calorie-adjusted intakes from the four one-week diet records and those from the questionnaire completed after the diet records ranged from 0.36 for vitamin A without supplements to 0.75 for vitamin C with supplements. Overall, 48{\%} of subjects in the lowest quintile of calorie-adjusted intake computed from the diet records were also in the lowest questionnaire quintile, and 74{\%} were in the lowest one of two questionnaire quintiles. Similarly, 49{\%} of those in the highest diet record quintile were also in the highest questionnaire quintile, and 77{\%} were in the highest one or two questionnaire quintiles. These data indicate that a simple self-administered dietary questionnaire can provide useful information about individual nutrient intakes over a one-year period.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Rice is known to be high in arsenic, including in infant rice cereal. Although arsenic in drinking water is currently regulated, there are currently no US regulations regarding arsenic concentrations in food. 

OBJECTIVE
We used published values to estimate arsenic exposure via rice cereal relative to breast milk or formula for 6- to 12-month-old infants in the general US population. 

RESULTS
We found that arsenic exposure from 3 servings of rice cereal exceeded that of formula made with water containing arsenic at 10 $\mu$g/L, the US Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant level. 

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that rice cereal can markedly increase arsenic exposure among US infants relative to breast milk and formula.},

	abstract = {As a postdoc exploring rice paddies in Cambodia in 2011, Angelia Seyfferth was struck by the towering mounds of husks piling up outside rice mills. Rice husks, the hard outer layer that encloses each grain, are a byproduct of rice production. ``It is often considered a waste product that farmers are trying to get rid of,'' explains Seyfferth, now a soil biogeochemist at the University of Delaware in Newark. Maybe, she thought at the time, she could use a key nutrient in these discarded husks to help address a global health problem: arsenic contamination in the rice itself. Working as a postdoc in Cambodia in 2011, soil biogeochemist Angelia Seyfferth wondered whether the towering mounds of husks piling up outside rice mills could help mitigate arsenic contamination in rice. Image credit: Angelia Seyfferth. Arsenic, a pollutant stemming from industrial processes and pesticides, also naturally occurs in soil and groundwater in regions across the globe. In its inorganic form, it's highly toxic, with chronic exposure raising the risk for a host of health conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers (1). Drinking water is often a major exposure route. But in the early 2000s, researchers discovered that rice, a staple food for more than half the global population, can also contain arsenic (2). In 2012, a Consumer Reports analysis raised public awareness of the issue by showing that nearly all of 65 types of rice and rice products tested contained arsenic---many of them at concerning levels (3). In 2020, a team of researchers in the United Kingdom found that of 55 samples of commercial rice sold in the UK, more than half exceeded the European Commission's limit for inorganic arsenic levels suitable for infant food or direct feeding to infants (4).

@misc{Nemery1990,
	abstract = {The type of lung disease caused by metal compounds depends on the nature of the offending agent, its physicochemical form, the dose, exposure conditions and host factors. The fumes or gaseous forms of several metals, e.g. cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4, zinc chloride (ZnCl2), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), may lead to acute chemical pneumonitis and pulmonary oedema or to acute tracheobronchitis. Metal fume fever, which may follow the inhalation of metal fumes e.g. zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and many others, is a poorly understood influenza-like reaction, accompanied by an acute self-limiting neutrophil alveolitis. Chronic obstructive lung disease may result from occupational exposure to mineral dusts, including probably some metallic dusts, or from jobs involving the working of metal compounds, such as welding. Exposure to cadmium may lead to emphysema. Bronchial asthma may be caused by complex platinum salts, nickel, chromium or cobalt, presumably on the basis of allergic sensitization. The cause of asthma in aluminium workers is unknown. It is remarkable that asthma induced by nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr) is apparently infrequent, considering their potency and frequent involvement as dermal sensitizers. Metallic dusts deposited in the lung may give rise to pulmonary fibrosis and functional impairment, depending on the fibrogenic potential of the agent and on poorly understood host factors. Inhalation of iron compounds causes siderosis, a pneumoconiosis with little or no fibrosis. Hard metal lung disease is a fibrosis characterized by desquamative and giant cell interstitial pneumonitis and is probably caused by cobalt, since a similar disease has been observed in workers exposed to cobalt in the absence of tungsten carbide. Chronic beryllium disease is a fibrosis with sarcoid-like epitheloid granulomas and is presumably due to cell-mediated immune response to beryllium. Such a mechanism may be responsible for the pulmonary fibrosis occasionally found in subjects exposed to other metals e.g. aluminium (Al), titanium (Ti), rare earths. The proportion of lung cancer attributable to occupation is around 15{\%}, with exposure to metals being frequently incriminated. Underground mining of e.g. uranium or iron is associated with a high incidence of lung cancer, as a result of exposure to radon. At least some forms of arsenic, chromium and nickel are well established lung carcinogens in humans. There is also evidence for increased lung cancer mortality in cadmium workers and in iron or steel workers.},

	abstract = {Recently, epidemiologic studies of developmental neurotoxicology have been challenged to increase focus on co-exposure to multiple toxicants. Earlier reports, including our own work in Bangladesh, have demonstrated independent associations between neurobehavioral function and exposure to both arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn) in school-aged children. Our earlier studies, however, were not designed to examine possible interactive effects of exposure to both As and Mn. To allow investigation of possible synergistic impact of simultaneous exposures, we recruited a new sample of 299 8-11 year old children, stratified by design on As (above and below 10$\mu$g/L) and Mn (above and below 500$\mu$g/L) concentrations of household wells. When adjusted only for each other, both As and Mn in whole blood (BAs; BMn) were significantly negatively related to most WISC-IV subscale scores. With further adjustment for socio-demographic features and ferritin, BMn remained significantly associated with reduced Perceptual Reasoning and Working Memory scores; associations for BAs, and for other subscales, were expectably negative, significantly for Verbal Comprehension. Urinary As (per gram creatinine) was significantly negatively associated with Verbal Comprehension scores, even with adjustment for BMn and other contributors. Mn by As interactions were not significant in adjusted or unadjusted models (all p's. {\textgreater} 0.25). Findings are consistent with other reports documenting adverse impact of both As and Mn exposure on child developmental outcomes, although associations appear muted at these relatively low exposure levels. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {It is known that a high fraction of methylarsonate (MA) in urine is a risk modifying factor for several arsenic induced health effects, including skin lesions, and that men are more susceptible for developing skin lesions than women. Thus, we aimed at elucidating the interaction between gender and arsenic metabolism for the risk of developing skin lesions. This study is part of a population-based case-referent study concerning the risk for skin lesions in relation to arsenic exposure via drinking water carried out in Matlab, a rural area 53km south-east of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We randomly selected 526 from 1579 referents and all 504 cases for analysis of arsenic metabolites in urine using HPLC coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-HG-ICPMS). The present study confirm previous studies, with the risk for skin lesions being almost three times higher in the highest tertile of {\%}MA (adjusted OR 2.8, 95{\%} CI: 1.9-4.2, p {\textless} 0.001) compared to the lowest tertile. The present study is the first to show that the well documented higher risk for men to develop arsenic-related skin lesions compared to women is mainly explained by the less efficient methylation of arsenic, as defined by a higher fraction of MA and lower fraction of DMA in the urine, among men. Our previously documented lower risk for skin lesions in individuals exposed since infancy, or before, was found to be independent of the observed arsenic methylation efficiency. Thus, it can be speculated that this is due to a programming effect of arsenic in utero. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Bobb2018,
	abstract = {Estimating the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures is of increasing interest in environmental epidemiology. Recently, a new approach for estimating the health effects of mixtures, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), has been developed. This method estimates the multivariable exposure-response function in a flexible and parsimonious way, conducts variable selection on the (potentially high-dimensional) vector of exposures, and allows for a grouped variable selection approach that can accommodate highly correlated exposures. However, the application of this novel method has been limited by a lack of available software, the need to derive interpretable output in a computationally efficient manner, and the inability to apply the method to non-continuous outcome variables. This paper addresses these limitations by (i) introducing an open-source software package in the R programming language, the bkmr R package, (ii) demonstrating methods for visualizing high-dimensional exposure-response functions, and for estimating scientifically relevant summaries, (iii) illustrating a probit regression implementation of BKMR for binary outcomes, and (iv) describing a fast version of BKMR that utilizes a Gaussian predictive process approach. All of the methods are illustrated using fully reproducible examples with the provided R code. Applying the methods to a continuous outcome example illustrated the ability of the BKMR implementation to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures in the context of a highly nonlinear, biologically-based dose-response function, and to estimate overall, single-exposure, and interactive health effects. The Gaussian predictive process method led to a substantial reduction in the runtime, without a major decrease in accuracy. In the setting of a larger number of exposures and a dichotomous outcome, the probit BKMR implementation was able to correctly identify the variables included in the exposure-response function and yielded interpretable quantities on the scale of a latent continuous outcome or on the scale of the outcome probability. This newly developed software, integrated suite of tools, and extended methodology makes BKMR accessible for use across a broad range of epidemiological applications in which multiple risk factors have complex effects on health.},

	abstract = {Because arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn) are able to pass the placenta, infants among exposed populations may be exposed to considerable levels in utero. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate infant toenails, hair, and cord blood as biomarkers of prenatal exposure to As and Mn and determine the relationship between maternal and infant As and Mn concentrations in these biomarkers. Of the 1196 pregnant women in Bangladesh who were monitored throughout pregnancy until 1 month post-partum and completed all study visits, we included 711 mother-infant pairs who had at least one maternal and one infant biomarker of exposure available for analysis. Toenail and hair samples were collected from the women during the first trimester and 1 month post-partum and from the infants at the age of 1 month. Cord blood was collected at the time of delivery. Maternal toenail concentrations were correlated with infant toenail concentrations for As and Mn (n=258, r=0.52, 95{\%} CI: 0.43-0.60, P{\textless}0.0001 and r=0.39, 95{\%} CI: 0.28-0.49, P{\textless}0.0001), respectively. Similarly, maternal hair concentrations were correlated with infant hair As (n=685, r=0.61, 95{\%} CI: 0.56-0.65, P{\textless}0.0001) and infant hair Mn (n=686, r=0.21, 95{\%} CI: 0.14-0.28, P{\textless}0.0001). Cord blood As was correlated with infant toenail and hair As, although cord blood Mn was only correlated with infant toenail. Toenails and cord blood appear to be valid biomarkers of maternal-fetal transfer of As and Mn, whereas hair may not be a suitable biomarker for in utero exposure to Mn.},

We used linear mixed-effects models to examine associations between metals and repeated measures of each outcome, controlling for covariates. Principal components analysis reduced the biomarkers to predictors that may share some commonality. We found that an interquartile range increase in selenium was inversely associated with femur length z score as well as other growth outcomes. Other essential metals, however, were associated with an increase in growth. Finally, the PCA component comprised of arsenic, mercury, and tin was associated with decreased head circumference z score (−0.14 [95{\%} CI, −0.23, −0.05]). Keywords:},

	abstract = {Organoarsenic compounds are widely used in chicken feed for control of coccidial parasite, quick weight gain, and for imparting attractive color to the chicken flesh. A study was conducted to assess the level of arsenic in both chicken feed and flesh. Chicken feed was collected from 10 farm houses and total arsenic was estimated. The quantitative estimation suggests that the four levels of chicken feed contain different quantities of arsenic load. The results demonstrated that feed at stages III and IV levels contain 0.01 mg/g and 0.018 mg/g of arsenic respectively. However, at stages I and II levels, the feed contains 0.005 mg/g and 0.0052 mg/g of arsenic respectively. Proceeding similarly, chicken flesh was collected from ten vendors in the local markets of Burdwan. The experimental results revealed that deposition of arsenic in different parts of chicken body is not same. The highest accumulation was recorded in the flesh of chest followed by stomach, whereas flesh of the legs and heart showed lower levels of arsenic accumulation. A comprehensive calculation was thereafter done to assess the total amount of arsenic ingestion through consumption of chicken. If a person takes 60.0 g of chicken flesh (leg, breast, muscles, and stomach) everyday, then the person may consume 0.186--0.372 $\mu$g of arsenic per day. This study therefore clearly suggests that excessive consumption of poultry chicken may prove to be fatal. However, further research is necessary to confirm the present findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably the first report on the likelihood of arsenic contamination in the flesh of different body parts of poultry chicken from Eastern India.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a human carcinogen that occurs ubiquitously in soil and water. Based on epidemiological studies, a benchmark dose (lower/higher bound estimate) between 0.3 and 8 $\mu$g/kg bw/day was estimated to cause a 1 {\%} increased risk of lung, skin and bladder cancer. A recently published study by EFSA on dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic in the European population reported 95th percentiles (lower bound min to upper bound max) for different age groups in the same range as the benchmark dose. For toddlers, a highly exposed group, the highest values ranged between 0.61 and 2.09 µg arsenic/kg bw/day. For all other age classes, the margin of exposure is also small. This scenario calls for regulatory action to reduce arsenic exposure. One priority measure should be to reduce arsenic in food categories that contribute most to exposure. In the EFSA study the food categories 'milk and dairy products,' 'drinking water' and 'food for infants' represent major sources of inorganic arsenic for infants and also rice is an important source. Long-term strategies are required to reduce inorganic arsenic in these food groups. The reduced consumption of rice and rice products which has been recommended may be helpful for a minority of individuals consuming unusually high amounts of rice. However, it is only of limited value for the general European population, because the food categories 'grain-based processed products (non rice-based)' or 'milk and dairy products' contribute more to the exposure with inorganic arsenic than the food category 'rice.' A balanced regulatory activity focusing on the most relevant food categories is required. In conclusion, exposure to inorganic arsenic represents a risk to the health of the European population, particularly to young children. Regulatory measures to reduce exposure are urgently required.},

@article{Hudgens2016,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND Because some adverse health effects associated with chronic arsenic exposure may be mediated by methylated arsenicals, interindividual variation in capacity to convert inorganic arsenic into mono- and di-methylated metabolites may be an important determinant of risk associated with exposure to this metalloid. Hence, identifying biological and behavioral factors that modify an individual's capacity to methylate inorganic arsenic could provide insights into critical dose-response relations underlying adverse health effects. METHODS A total of 904 older adults (≥45 years old) in Churchill County, Nevada, who chronically used home tap water supplies containing up to 1850 $\mu$g of arsenic per liter provided urine and toenail samples for determination of total and speciated arsenic levels. Effects of biological factors (gender, age, body mass index) and behavioral factors (smoking, recent fish or shellfish consumption) on patterns of arsenicals in urine were evaluated with bivariate analyses and multivariate regression models. RESULTS Relative contributions of inorganic, mono-, and di-methylated arsenic to total speciated arsenic in urine were unchanged over the range of concentrations of arsenic in home tap water supplies used by study participants. Gender predicted both absolute and relative amounts of arsenicals in urine. Age predicted levels of inorganic arsenic in urine and body mass index predicted relative levels of mono- and di-methylated arsenic in urine. Smoking predicted both absolute and relative levels of arsenicals in urine. Multivariate regression models were developed for both absolute and relative levels of arsenicals in urine. Concentration of arsenic in home tap water and estimated water consumption were strongly predictive of levels of arsenicals in urine as were smoking, body mass index, and gender. Relative contributions of arsenicals to urinary arsenic were not consistently predicted by concentrations of arsenic in drinking water supplies but were more consistently predicted by gender, body mass index, age, and smoking. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that analyses of dose-response relations in arsenic-exposed populations should account for biological and behavioral factors that modify levels of inorganic and methylated arsenicals in urine. Evidence of significant effects of these factors on arsenic metabolism may also support mode of action studies in appropriate experimental models.},

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about rice consumption, related food intake patterns, and the nutritional contribution that rice provides in the diets of Americans. Objective: To provide information about rice consumption in the United States and the diets of rice consumers. Design: Data come from the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2002). Respondents report 24-hour recall dietary intakes. The amount of rice available in foods is estimated using the Food Commodity Intake Database. Consumers are classified based on the amount of rice they consume in foods. Subjects: The analysis includes information from adult individuals: 9,318 from the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals and 4,744 from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Statistics: Weighted percentages and mean values show the food and nutrient intake amounts. Logistic regression analysis is used to examine relationships among economic, social, and demographic factors that affect rice consumption. Results: Rice is consumed by a significant portion of the US adult population. Compared with others who did not consume rice, rice consumers consumed a smaller share of energy per day from fat and saturated fat; more iron and potassium; and more dietary fiber, meat, vegetables, and grains. Race/ethnicity and education are determinants of the probability of consuming rice, and more so than low-income status. Conclusions: Rice consumers choose a diet that includes more vegetables, a smaller share of energy from fat and saturated fat, more dietary fiber and more iron than those who do not consume rice; the differences have remained relatively stable over the last decade. Accounting for race/ethnicity and income levels is important for better understanding of factors that affect food choices and for effective design of dietary interventions. ?? 2009 American Dietetic Association.},

This paper reviews how active research in West Bengal has unmasked the endemic arsenism that has detrimental effects on the health of millions of people and their offspring. It documents how the pathways of exposure to this toxin/poison have been greatly expanded through intensive application of groundwater in agriculture in the region within the Green Revolution framework. A goal of this paper is to compare and contrast the similarities and differences in arsenic occurrence in West Bengal with those of other parts of the world and assess the unique socio-cultural factors that determine the risks of exposure to arsenic in local groundwater. Successful intervention options are also critically reviewed with emphasis on integrative strategies that ensure safe water to the population, proper nutrition, and effective ways to reduce the transfer of arsenic from soil to crops. While no universal model may be suited for the vast areas of the world affected with by natural contamination of groundwater with arsenic, we have emphasized community-specific sustainable options that can be adapted.

Assessment studies of metals and metalloids in Malaysia is very scarce although cross-sectional nationwide human biomonitoring surveys have been established by the USA, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, and Korea. This study aims to assess urinary metal levels namely cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and arsenic (As) among Malaysian adults. This was a cross-sectional study involving 1440 adults between the age of 18 and 88 years old. After excluding those with 24 h urine samples of less than 500 ml, urine creatinine levels {\textless} 0.3 or {\textgreater} 3.0 g/L and those who refuse to participate in the study, a total of 817 respondents were included for analysis. A questionnaire with socio-demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, ethnic, academic qualification and medical history was administered to the respondents. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected in a container before being transported at 4 $\,^{\circ}$C to the laboratory. Samples were then aliquoted into 15 ml tubes and kept at − 80 $\,^{\circ}$C until further analysis. Urine was diluted ten-fold with ultrapure water, filtered and analysed for metals and metalloids using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The geometric mean of urinary As, Ni, Cd and Pb concentrations among adults in Malaysia was 48.21, 4.37, 0.32, and 0.80 µg/L, respectively. Males showed significantly higher urinary metal concentrations compared to females for As, Cd and Pb except for Ni. Those who resided in rural areas exhibited significantly higher As, Cd and Pb urinary concentrations than those who resided in urban areas. As there are no nationwide data on urinary metals, findings from this study could be used to identify high exposure groups, thus enabling policy makers to improve public health strategically.},

	abstract = {In order to identify spatial relationship of heavy metals in soil-rice system at a regional scale, 96 pairs of rice and soil samples were collected from Wenling in Zhejiang province, China, which is one of the well-known electronic and electric waste recycling centers. The results indicated some studied areas had potential contaminations by heavy metals, especially by Cd. The spatial distribution of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn illustrated that the highest concentrations were located in the northwest areas and the accumulation of these metals may be due to the industrialization, agricultural chemicals and other human activities. In contrast, the concentration of Ni decreased from east to west and the mean concentration was below the background value, indicating the distribution of Ni may be naturally controlled. Enrichment index (EI) was used to describe the availability of soil heavy metals to rice. The spatial distribution of EIs for Cd, Ni and Zn exhibited a west-east structure, which was similar with the spatial structures of pH, OM, sand and clay. Cross-correlograms further quantitatively illustrated the EIs were significantly correlated with most soil properties, among which; soil pH and OM had the strongest correlations with EIs. However, EI of Cu showed relative weak correlations with soil properties, especially soil pH and OM had no correlations with EI of Cu, indicating the availability of Cu may be influenced by other factors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Context: Arsenic is a rare crystal element that naturally occurs in all environmental media. A combination of regional and site-specific biogeochemical and hydrological factors governs its dispersion in the environment. It has far reaching consequences on human health. Exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been associated with a decline in intellectual function in children. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between exposure to arsenic by drinking water and children's intelligence in Karnataka state, India. Settings and Design: Twenty school children of age 10-14 years from Sandur, Bellary, Karnataka, and from Hutti, Raichur, Karnataka, were categorized as control and study group, respectively. Subjects and Methods: Water samples were collected from both the villages for the analysis of arsenic and fluoride levels. Hair and nail samples were collected from the participants, and the arsenic levels were determined. Intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment was done using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Fisher's exact test. P{\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There was a significant increase in the arsenic content in the hair and nail samples of children in the study group. The mean IQ tests score in the control group and study group was 30.55 and 17.95, respectively, and this difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: Chronic arsenic exposure could be a possible cause for the reduced IQ scores seen in children residing in Hutti, Raichur District, North Karnataka.},

	abstract = {The link between arsenic exposure and deficits in children's neurodevelopment has been suggested, but it remains unclear regarding the arsenic-related effects on the developing brain in early life. To investigate the associations of in utero arsenic exposure with neonatal neurobehavioral development, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 892 mother-infant pairs from 10 hospitals of different levels in Shanghai, China. The concentrations of arsenic were determined in cord blood samples. Neurobehavioral measures were administered at 3 days postpartum in full-term newborns using the neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for dichotomous NBNA outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders, a natural log unit (ln-unit) increase in cord blood arsenic was associated with 90{\%} increased odds of low NBNA score (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.62, 2.23). As for clusters, each ln-unit arsenic increase was associated with 47{\%} increased odds of low score for behavior (95{\%} CI: 1.31, 1.66) and 36{\%} increased odds of low score for passive muscle tone (95{\%} CI: 1.23, 1.51). Odds ratios comparing extreme tertiles were 8.62 (95{\%} CI: 4.19, 17.8) for total scale, 3.69 (95{\%} CI: 2.35, 5.82) for behavior, and 3.32 (95{\%} CI: 2.21, 4.97) for passive tone (all p-trend {\textless} 0.001). Stratified analyses showed that these associations were strengthened in newborns of mothers over 29 years of age. Our results provide evidence for an inverse association between low-level prenatal arsenic exposure and neurobehavioral performance of newborns, particularly among those born to older mothers. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to determine whether such decrements in early neurodevelopment persist in later childhood.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is an important contaminant present in food and water. Several studies have indicated that the occurrence of As based skin lesions is significantly different when root and gourd rich diets are consumed compared to meat rich diets. Additionally, urinary As speciation from orally exposed individuals appears to depend on the composition of the diet. These observations imply that diet composition can affect both the bioavailable As fraction as the As speciation in the body. In this study, we used the in vitro gastrointestinal method (IVG) to evaluate how an Asian type diet (fiber rich) and a Western type diet (fat and protein rich), differ in their capability to release inorganic As (iAs(V)) and dimethyl arsinate (DMA(V)) from a rice matrix following gastrointestinal digestion. Moreover, we used a validated dynamic gut simulator to investigate whether diet background affects As metabolism by gut microbiota in a colon environment. An Asian diet background resulted in a larger As bioaccessibility (81.2{\%}) than a Western diet background (63.4{\%}). On the other hand, incubation of As contaminated rice with human colon microbiota in the presence of a Western type diet resulted in a larger amount of hazardous As species - monomethyl arsonite and monomethylmonothio arsonate - to be formed after 48h. The permeability of these As species (60.5{\%} and 50.5{\%} resp.) across a Caco-2 cell line was significantly higher compared to iAs(V) and DMA(V) (46.5{\%} and 28{\%} resp.). We conclude that dietary background is a crucial parameter to incorporate when predicting bioavailability with bioaccessibility measurements and when assessing health risks from As following oral exposure.},

	abstract = {Arsenic exposure is a worldwide health concern associated with an increased risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancer but arsenic trioxide (AsIII) is also an effective chemotherapeutic agent. The current use of AsIII in chemotherapy is limited to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, AsIII was suggested as a potential therapy for other cancer types including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially when combined with other drugs. Here, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR-based approach to identify modulators of AsIII toxicity in K562, a human CML cell line. We found that disruption of KEAP1, the inhibitory partner of the key antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, or TXNDC17, a thioredoxin-like protein, markedly increased AsIII tolerance. Loss of the water channel AQP3, the zinc transporter ZNT1 and its regulator MTF1 also enhanced tolerance to AsIII whereas loss of the multidrug resistance protein ABCC1 increased sensitivity to AsIII. Remarkably, disruption of any of multiple genes, EEFSEC, SECISBP2, SEPHS2, SEPSECS, and PSTK, encoding proteins involved in selenocysteine metabolism increased resistance to AsIII. Our data suggest a model in which an intracellular interaction between selenium and AsIII may impact intracellular AsIII levels and toxicity. Together this work revealed a suite of cellular components/processes which modulate the toxicity of AsIII in CML cells. Targeting such processes simultaneously with AsIII treatment could potentiate AsIII in CML therapy.},

@article{Mulware2013,
	abstract = {Cancer is known to be a multi-step process, which involves different stages including initiation, promotion, progression and metastasis. Chemical carcinogens including most trace elements can change any of these processes to induce their carcinogenic effects. Various studies confirm that cancer arises from the accumulation of irreversible DNA damage, which results from multiple mutations in critical genes in the body organ. Chemical carcinogens most often directly or after xenobiotic metabolism, act as genotoxic causes to induce DNA damage. Genotoxic carcinogen refers to a group of chemicals capable of producing cancer by directly altering the genetic material of target cells. Other carcinogens are however classified as non-genotoxic, which represents chemicals that are capable of producing cancer by some secondary mechanism not related to direct gene damage. They act as tumor promoters, endocrine-modifiers, receptor mediators, immunosuppressant, or inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory responses. The diversity of modes of action, of non-genotoxic carcinogens, the tissue and species specificity and the absence of genotoxicity makes it extremely hard to predict their carcinogenic potential. The roles of trace metals (some of which are either genotoxic or non-genotoxic) in cancer development and inhibition have a complex character and have raised many questions because of their essential and toxic effects on people's health. Trace metals such as cadmium, nickel, arsenic, beryllium and chromium (VI) have been recognized as human or animal carcinogens by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The Carcinogenic capability of these metals depends mainly on factors such as oxidation states and chemical structures. The oxidative concept in metal carcinogenesis proposes that complexes formed by these metals, in vivo, in the vicinity of DNA, catalyze redox reactions, which in turn oxidize DNA. The most significant effect of reactive oxygen species in the carcinogenesis progression is DNA damage, which results in DNA lesions like strand breaks and the sister-chromatid exchange. This article reviews the carcinogenicity of various trace elements. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Exposure to i-As is of particular concern among pregnant women, infants and children, as they are specifically vulnerable to the adverse health effects of i-As, and in utero and early-life exposure, even low to moderate levels of i-As, may have a marked effect throughout the lifespan. Ion chromatography-mass spectrometry detection (IC-ICP-MS) was used to analyse urinary arsenic speciation, as an exposure biomarker, in samples of 4-year-old children with relatively low-level arsenic exposure living in different regions in Spain including Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell and Valencia. The profile of arsenic metabolites in urine was also determined in samples taken during pregnancy (1st trimester) and in the children from Valencia of 7 years old. The median of the main arsenic species found in the 4-year-old children was 9.71 {\$}\mu{\$}g/l (arsenobetaine---AsB), 3.97 {\$}\mu{\$}g/l (dimethylarsinic acid---DMA), 0.44 {\$}\mu{\$}g/l (monomethylarsonic acid---MMA) and 0.35 {\$}\mu{\$}g/l (i-As). Statistically significant differences were found in urinary AsB, MMA and i-As according to the study regions in the 4-year-old, and also in DMA among pregnant women and their children. Spearman's correlation coefficient among urinary arsenic metabolites was calculated, and, in general, a strong methylation capacity to methylate i-As to MMA was observed.},

	abstract = {Summary: Background There is evidence from two meta-analyses that children born through caesarean section (C-section) may have an increased risk of developing asthma compared with those born through vaginal delivery.Objective To evaluate the association between mode of delivery and wheezing (current and persistent) in childhood and adolescence, in two birth cohort studies in Brazil.Methods The outcome variable was based on the International Study of Allergy and Asthma questionnaire, which collects information about wheezing within the 12 months before the interview. Persistent wheezing was defined when it was present in more than one follow-up at different ages, in the 1993 cohort. The questions were asked to mothers when children were aged 4 years (1993 and 2004 cohorts) and directly to cohort participants at 11 and 15 years (1993 cohort). Mode of delivery was collected by the research team of each cohort when children were born.Results Response rates in the last follow-up visit of the 1993 and 2004 cohorts were 85{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively. The prevalence of current wheezing increased from 20{\%} to 28{\%} at 4 years from 1993 to 2004; at 11 and 15 years, the prevalence was around 14{\%} and 12{\%}, in the 1993 cohort. The proportion of C-sections increased from 30.5{\%} to 45{\%} between 1993 and 2004. In each cohort, the prevalence of current wheezing was similar among children born through vaginal and C-section. The risk for persistent wheezing in the 1993 cohort was higher among girls born through C-section than boys.Conclusion Despite the increase in the proportion of C-section in two cohorts in Southern Brazil, we found no evidence of an association between mode of delivery and the subsequent risk of wheezing. Among girls, although there was no statistical significance, the risk was higher for those born by C-section, especially regarding persistent wheezing. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the impact of postnatal dexamethasone treatment on the neonatal unit on the school age lung function of very prematurely born children. Children born prior to 29 weeks of gestational age had been entered into a randomised trial of two methods of neonatal ventilation (United Kingdom Oscillation Study). They had comprehensive lung function measurements at 11 to 14 years of age. One hundred and seventy-nine children born at a mean gestational age of 26.9 (range 23--28) weeks were assessed at 11 to 14 years; 50 had received postnatal dexamethasone. Forced expiratory flow at 75{\%} (FEF75), 50{\%}, 25{\%} and 25--75{\%} of the expired vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity and lung volumes including total lung capacity and residual volume were assessed. Lung function outcomes were compared between children who had and had not been exposed to dexamethasone after adjustment for neonatal factors using linear mixed effects regression. After adjustment for confounders all the mean spirometry results were between 0.38 and 0.87 standard deviations lower in those exposed to dexamethasone compared to the unexposed. For example, the mean FEF75 z-score was 0.53 lower (95{\%} CI 0.21 to 0.85). The mean lung function was lower as the number of courses of dexamethasone increased. In conclusion, postnatal dexamethasone exposure was associated with lower mean lung function at school age in children born extremely prematurely. Our results suggest the larger the cumulative dose the greater the adverse effect on lung function at follow-up.},

This study evaluated total arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice cooked with arsenic-contaminated water, the bioaccessibility of As(III) and As(V) after simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and the extent of arsenic retention and transport by Caco-2 cells used as a model of intestinal epithelia. After cooking, inorganic arsenic contents increase significantly. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, the bioaccessibility of inorganic arsenic reached 63-99{\%}; As(V) was the main species found. In Caco-2 cells, arsenic retention, transport, and total uptake (retention + transport) varied between 0.6 and 6.4, 3.3 and 11.4, and 3.9 and 17.8{\%}, respectively. These results show that in arsenic endemic areas with subsistence rice diets, the contribution of inorganic arsenic from cooked rice should be considered in assessments of arsenic health risk.},

	abstract = {Context: Urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) is a disease of significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand the risk factors of this disease. Objective: To describe the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of UBC and to review and interpret the current evidence on and impact of the related risk factors. Evidence acquisition: A literature search in English was performed using PubMed. Relevant papers on the epidemiology of UBC were selected. Evidence synthesis: UBC is the 7th most common cancer worldwide in men and the 17th most common cancer worldwide in women. Approximately 75{\%} of newly diagnosed UBCs are noninvasive. Each year, approximately 110 500 men and 70 000 women are diagnosed with new cases and 38 200 patients in the European Union and 17 000 US patients die from UBC. Smoking is the most common risk factor and accounts for approximately half of all UBCs. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are other important risk factors. The impact of diet and environmental pollution is less evident. Increasing evidence suggests a significant influence of genetic predisposition on incidence. Conclusions: UBC is a frequently occurring malignancy with a significant impact on public health and will remain so because of the high prevalence of smoking. The importance of primary prevention must be stressed, and smoking cessation programs need to be encouraged and supported. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Association of Urology.

@article{Gutierrez-Gonzalez2019,
	abstract = {Health problems associated with essential trace metals can result from both inadequate (i.e., low intake) and excessive exposures (i.e., from environmental and/or occupational source). Thus, measuring the exposure level is a real challenge for epidemiologists. Among non-invasive biomarkers that intend to measure long-term exposure to essential trace metals, the toenail is probably the biological matrix with the greatest potential. This systematic review collects the current evidence regarding the validity of toenail clippings as exposure biomarker for trace metals such as boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, silicon, vanadium and zinc. Special attention was paid to the time-window of exposure reflected by the toenail, the intraindividual variability in exposure levels over time in this matrix, and the relationship of toenail with other biomarkers, personal characteristics and environmental sources. Our search identified 139 papers, with selenium and zinc being the most studied elements. The variability among studies suggests that toenail levels may reflect different degrees of exposure and probably correspond to exposures occurred 3--12 months before sampling (i.e., for manganese/selenium). Few studies assessed the reproducibility of results over time and, for samples obtained 1--6 years apart, the correlation coefficient were between 0.26 and 0.66. Trace metal levels in toenails did not correlate well with those in the blood and urine and showed low-moderate correlation with those in the hair and fingernails. Available data suggests that for some elements (Se, Mn, Zn) toenail concentrations reflect long-term external exposures in fairly reproducible levels, while for other metals, this association has not yet been assessed. Among dietary factors, only toenail selenium showed clear associations with the intake of supplements or specific foods. The toenail levels could also represent occupational exposure, for instance, Mn exposure in welders. The scarcity of information on other essential trace elements, together with the great heterogeneity among studies makes the validation of the usage of toenails as biomarkers of exposure to these elements difficult. Standardization of sample collection, quality control, analytical techniques and reporting procedures might facilitate further research focused on the clear understanding of the significance of essential levels in this promising matrix and would enhance its utility in epidemiological research.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades there has been an increased concern about the health risks from exposure to metallic trace elements, including arsenic, because of their potential neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. This study assessed whether urinary arsenic (UA) levels are associated with attention performance and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children living in an area with high industrial and mining activities in Southwestern Spain. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 261 children aged 6-9 years. Arsenic levels were determined in urine samples. Attention was measured by using 4 independent tools: a) tests from the Behavioral Assessment and Research System (BARS) designed to measure attention function: Simple Reaction Time Test (RTT), Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Selective Attention Test (SAT); b) AULA Test, a virtual reality (VR)-based test that evaluates children's response to several stimuli in an environment simulating a classroom; c) Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), administered to parents; and d) Teacher's Report Form (TRF), administered to teachers. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate the magnitude of the association between UA levels and attention performance scores. Higher UA levels were associated with an increased latency of response in RTT (??=12.3; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 3.5-21.1) and SAT (??=3.6; 95{\%} CI: .4-6.8) as well as with worse performance on selective and focalized attention in the AULA test (?? for impulsivity=.6; 95{\%} CI: .1-1.1; ?? for inattention=.5; 95{\%} CI: .03-1.0). A dose-response relationship was observed between UA levels and inattention and impulsivity scores. In contrast, results from the CBCL and TRF tests failed to show a significant association with UA levels. In conclusion, UA levels were associated with impaired attention/cognitive function, even at levels considered safe. These results provide additional evidence that postnatal arsenic exposure impairs neurological function in children.},

	abstract = {Rice is an essential staple food and feeds over half of the world's population. Consumption of rice has increased from limited intake in Western countries some 50??years ago to major dietary intake now. Rice consumption represents a major route for inorganic arsenic (As) exposure in many countries, especially for people with a large proportion of rice in their daily diet as much as 60{\%}. Rice plants are more efficient in assimilating As into its grains than other cereal crops and the accumulation may also adversely affect the quality of rice and their nutrition. Rice is generally grown as a lowland crop in flooded soils under reducing conditions. Under these conditions the bioavailability of As is greatly enhanced leading to excessive As bioaccumulation compared to that under oxidizing upland conditions. Inorganic As species are carcinogenic to humans and even at low levels in the diet pose a considerable risk to humans. There is a substantial genetic variation among the rice genotypes in grain-As accumulation as well as speciation. Identifying the extent of genetic variation in grain-As concentration and speciation of As compounds are crucial to determining the rice varieties which accumulate low inorganic As. Varietal selection, irrigation water management, use of fertilizer and soil amendments, cooking practices etc. play a vital role in reducing As exposure from rice grains. In the meantime assessing the bioavailability of As from rice is crucial to understanding human health exposure and reducing the risk.},

The intakes assessed are in the lower range of iAs exposure estimates in other European countries carried out without the support of the TDS approach. However, taking the lower limit of the BMDL01range established by the EFSA as reference point, the margins of exposure are {\textless}2 for the mean intake in infants and toddlers and {\textless}1 for the 95th percentile intakes in all younger age groups.

A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the relationship among the levels of urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), the arsenic profile, and urothelial carcinoma (UC). Urinary 8-OHdG was measured by using high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The urinary species of inorganic arsenic and their metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and hydride generator-atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS). This study showed that the mean urinary concentration of total arsenics was significantly higher, at 37.67 $\pm$ 2.98 $\mu$g/g creatinine, for UC patients than for healthy controls of 21.10 $\pm$ 0.79 $\mu$g/g creatinine (p {\textless} 0.01). Urinary 8-OHdG levels correlated with urinary total arsenic concentrations (r = 0.19, p {\textless} 0.01). There were significantly higher 8-OHdG levels, of 7.48 $\pm$ 0.97 ng/mg creatinine in UC patients, compared to healthy controls of 5.95 $\pm$ 0.21 ng/mg creatinine. Furthermore, female UC patients had higher 8-OHdG levels of 9.22 $\pm$ 0.75 than those of males at 5.76 $\pm$ 0.25 ng/mg creatinine (p {\textless} 0.01). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that high urinary 8-OHdG levels were associated with increased total arsenic concentrations, inorganic arsenite, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsenate (DMA) as well as the primary methylation index (PMI) even after adjusting for age, gender, and UC status. The results suggest that oxidative DNA damage was associated with arsenic exposure, even at low urinary level of arsenic. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To study the effect of eating foods with a high arsenic (As) content on the intra and inter-individual variability of urinary concentrations of the As species, daily urine samples were collected for 10 consecutive days from 12 healthy male subjects. A daily food diary was kept throughout the study period. Personal exposure to airborne As was measured once during the study. As 3, As 5, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and arsenobetaine were determined in all urine samples by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the sum of As 3+As 5+MMA+DMA (iAs) by hydride generation-atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Exposure to airborne As was below the limit of detection in all samplings. As 3 was found in only 19.2{\%} and As 5 in only 3.3{\%} of the urine samples, whereas high urinary concentrations of arsenobetaine were observed. With the exception of arsenobetaine, expressed as a percentage, a significant inter-individual variability was observed for all species of As, for iAs and for the MMA/DMA ratio (p{\textless}0.001). Instead, the intra-individual variability was significant only for the MMA/DMA ratio (p{\textless}0.001). Among foods with a high As content, only a heavy consumption of seafood was shown to influence inter-individual variability of DMA{\%}, arsenobetaine expressed as $\mu$gg -1 creatinine and iAs. In conclusion, even in populations with a high intake of organic As through foods, the finding of a significant inter-individual but no significant intra-individual variability of urinary species confirms the usefulness of urinary As speciation for biological monitoring of exposure to As. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Older individuals also provided urine (n = 362) and toenail (n = 67) samples. Speciated urinary arsenic levels were similar between children (geometric mean, geometric SD, and range: 4.0, 2.2, and 0.89-17.7 microg/L, respectively) and older participants (3.8, 1.9, 0.91-19.9 microg/L) and consistent with unexposed populations.

Correlations between speciated urinary arsenic and arsenic in soil (r = 0.137, p = 0.39; n = 41) or house dust (r = 0.049, p = 0.73; n = 52) were not significant for children. Similarly, questionnaire responses indicating soil exposure were not associated with increased urinary arsenic levels. Relatively low soil arsenic exposure likely precluded quantification of arsenic exposure above background.},

	abstract = {In risk evaluation, the effect of mixtures of environmental chemicals on a common adverse outcome is of interest. However, due to the high dimensionality and inherent cor-relations among chemicals that occur together, the traditional methods (e.g. ordinary or logistic regression) suffer from collinearity and variance inflation, and shrinkage meth-ods have limitations in selecting among correlated components. We propose a weighted quantile sum (WQS) approach to estimating a body burden index, which identifies " bad actors " in a set of highly correlated environmental chemicals. We evaluate and charac-terize the accuracy of WQS regression in variable selection through extensive simulation studies through sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ability of the WQS method to select the bad actors correctly and not incorrect ones). We demonstrate the improvement in accu-racy this method provides over traditional ordinary regression and shrinkage methods (lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net). Results from simulations demonstrate that WQS regression is accurate under some environmentally relevant conditions, but its accuracy decreases for a fixed correlation pattern as the association with a response variable dimin-ishes. Nonzero weights (i.e., weights exceeding a selection threshold parameter) may be used to identify bad actors; however, components within a cluster of highly correlated ac-tive components tend to have lower weights, with the sum of their weights representative of the set.

@article{Choi2010,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a known human carcinogen and widely distributed in the environment. The main route of As exposure in the general population is through food and drinking water. Seafood harvested in Korea contains high-level organoarsenics such as arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, and arsenosugars, which are much less harmful than inorganic arsenics. However, for those who eat large amounts of seafood it is important to understand whether seafood consumption affects urinary levels of inorganic As metabolites such as arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). In this study we investigated urinary As metabolites (inorganic As, MMA[V], DMA[V]) and some biological indexes such as AST, GSH, GPX, lipid peroxidation, and uric acid in volunteer study subjects (seven males and nine females). Total urinary As metabolites were analyzed by the hydride generation method, followed by arsenic speciation using HPLC with ICP-mass spectrometry. Study subjects refrained from eating seafood for 3 days prior to the first urine collection and then ingested seafood daily for 6 consecutive days. The first voided urine of the morning was collected from each subject the first day of the consecutive 6 days of seafood ingestion but prior to the first seafood meal. The first voided urine of the morning was also collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 14 after seafood ingestion. The daily mean intake of total As was 6.98 mg, comprised of 4.71 mg of seaweed (67{\%}), 1.74 mg of flat fish (25{\%}), and 0.53 mg of conch (8{\%}). We observed a substantial increase in total urinary As metabolites for subjects consuming seafood from day 1, which recovered to control level at day 10. The increase in total urinary As metabolites was attributed to the increase in DMA, which is a more harmful metabolite than organoarsenics. However, no significant changes in response biological indexes were observed. These results suggest that it is necessary to evaluate As metabolism when assessing the exposure to inorganic As and potential chronic health effects of seafood consumption in Korea.},

The arsenic concentration of cooked rice is known to increase with the arsenic concentration of the cooking water but the effects of cooking methods have not been defined. We tested the three major rice cooking procedures followed globally. Using low-arsenic water (As {\textless} 3 $\mu$g/L), the traditional method of the Indian subcontinent (wash until clear; cook with rice: water :: 1:6; discard excess water) removed up to 57{\%} of the arsenic from rice containing arsenic 203-540 $\mu$g/kg. Approximately half of the arsenic was lost in the wash water, half in the discard water. A simple inexpensive rice cooker based on this method has been designed and used for this purpose. Despite the use of low-arsenic water, the contemporary method of cooking unwashed rice at rice:water :: 1:1.5-2.0 until no discard water remains did not modify the arsenic content. Preliminary washing until clear did remove 28{\%} of the rice arsenic. The results were not influenced by water source (tubewell, dug well, pond or rain); cooking vessel (aluminium, steel, glass or earthenware); or the absolute weight of rice or volume of water. The use of low-As water in the traditional preparation of arsenic contaminated rice can reduce the ingested burden of arsenic. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although consumption of drinking water contaminated with inorganic arsenic is usually considered the primary exposure route, aggregate exposure to arsenic depends on direct consumption of water, use of water in food preparation, and the presence in arsenicals in foods. To gain insight into the effects of biological and behavioral factors on arsenic exposure, we determined arsenic concentrations in urine and toenails in a U.S. population that uses public or private water supplies containing inorganic arsenic. Study participants were 904 adult residents of Churchill County, Nevada, whose home tap water supplies contained {\textless}3 to about 1200 $\mu$g of arsenic per liter. Biomarkers of exposure for this study were summed urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites (speciated arsenical), of all urinary arsenicals (total arsenical), and of all toenail arsenicals (total arsenical). Increased tap water arsenic concentration and consumption were associated with significant upward trends for urinary speciated and total and toenail total arsenical concentrations. Significant gender differences in concentrations of speciated and total arsenicals in urine and toenails reflected male-female difference in water intake. Both recent and higher habitual seafood consumption significantly increased urinary total but not speciated arsenical concentration. In a stepwise general linear model, seafood consumption significantly predicted urinary total arsenical but not urinary speciated or toenail total arsenical concentrations. Smoking behavior significantly predicted urinary speciated or total arsenical concentration. Gender, tap water arsenic concentration, and primary drinking water source significantly predicted urinary speciated and total concentrations and toenail total arsenical concentrations. These findings confirm the primacy of home tap water as a determinant of arsenic concentration in urine and toenails. However, biological and behavioral factors can modify exposure-response relations for these biomarkers. Refining estimates of the influence of these factors will permit better models of dose-response relations for this important environmental contaminant. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The rice consumed in the study contained inorganic arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) at a ratio of 1:1, yet the urine speciation was dominated by DMA (90{\%}). At steady state (rice consumption/urinary excretion) ∼40{\%} of rice derived arsenic was excreted via urine. By monitoring of each urine pass throughout the day it was observed that there was considerable variation (up to 13-fold) for an individual's total arsenic urine content, and that there was a time dependent variation in urinary total arsenic content.

An explicit theoretical motivation for such an analysis has been missing from the epidemiological literature.

At all three time points, exclusively formula-fed infants had GM arsenic exposures ∼8 times higher than exclusively breastfed infants owing to arsenic in both tap water and formula powder. Estimated maximum exposures reached 9 $\mu$g/kg/day among exclusively formula-fed infants in households with high tap water arsenic (80 $\mu$g/l). Overall, modeled arsenic exposures via breast milk and formula were low throughout the first year of life, unless formula was prepared with arsenic-contaminated tap water.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a widespread contaminant of drinking and groundwaters in the world. Even if these contaminations have a geogenic origin, they often are exacerbated by anthropogenic activities. This is particularly true for the Bengal delta. Millions of people in Bangladesh are consuming drinking water with arsenic concentrations ≥ 50 µg/L. Their drinking water supply is based on groundwaters extracted by pumping wells, which were part of a well-drilling program by the United Nations. The intention was to provide the people with groundwater instead of surface water due to its critical hygienic conditions. Unfortunately, many wells extract the groundwater at depths where arsenic concentrations are highest. Arsenic is being dissolved from the aquifer by biogeochemical processes that are fueled by the presence of high amounts of organics in the Bengal delta sediments. This problem was not encountered at the time due to a lack of chemical analyses of the waters.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, tens of millions of people have been consuming waterborne arsenic for decades. The extent to which As is transported to the fetus during pregnancy has not been well characterized.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We therefore conducted a study of 101 pregnant women who gave birth in Matlab, Bangladesh.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Maternal and cord blood pairs were collected and concentrations of total As were analyzed for 101 pairs, and As metabolites for 30 pairs. Maternal urinary As metabolites and plasma folate, cobalamin, and homocysteine levels in maternal cord pairs were also measured. Household tube well-water As concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization guideline of 10 microg/L in 38{\%} of the cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We observed strong associations between maternal and cord blood concentrations of total As (r = 0.93, p {\textless} 0.0001). Maternal and cord blood arsenic metabolites (n = 30) were also strongly correlated: in dimethylarsinate (DMA) (r = 0.94, p {\textless} 0.0001), monomethylarsonate (r = 0.80, p {\textless} 0.0001), arsenite (As(+3)) (r = 0.80, p {\textless} 0.0001), and arsenate (As(+5)) (r = 0.89, p {\textless} 0.0001). Maternal homocysteine was a strong predictor of {\%}DMA in maternal urine, maternal blood, and cord blood (beta = -6.2, p {\textless} 0.02; beta = -10.9, p {\textless} 0.04; and beta = -13.7, p {\textless} 0.04, respectively). Maternal folate was inversely associated with maternal blood As(5+) (beta = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.05), and maternal cobalamin was inversely associated with cord blood As(5+) (beta = -1.2, p {\textless} 0.01).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that exposure to all metabolites of inorganic As occurs in the prenatal period.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The long-term impact of intentional weight loss on cardiovascular events remains unknown. We describe 12-month changes in body weight and cardiovascular risk factors in PREvenci{\'{o}}n con DIeta MEDiterr{\'{a}}nea (PREDIMED)-Plus, a trial designed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention on primary cardiovascular prevention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Overweight/obese adults with metabolic syndrome aged 55--75 years (n = 626) were randomized to an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet, physical activity promotion, and behavioral support (IG) or a control group (CG). The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in weight and cardiovascular risk markers, respectively. RESULTS Diet and physical activity changes were in the expected direction, with significant improvements in IG versus CG. After 12 months, IG participants lost an average of 3.2 kg vs. 0.7 kg in the CG (P {\textless} 0.001), a mean difference of 22.5 kg (95{\%} CI 23.1 to 21.9). Weight loss ‡5{\%} occurred in 33.7{\%} of IG participants compared with 11.9{\%} in the CG (P {\textless} 0.001). Compared with the CG, cardiovascular risk factors, including waist circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol, significantly improved in IG participants (P {\textless} 0.002). Reductions in insulin resistance, HbA1c, and circulating levels of leptin, interleukin-18, and MCP-1 were greater in IG than CG participants (P {\textless} 0.05). IG participants with prediabetes/diabetes significantly improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, along with triglycerides and HDL cholesterol levels compared with their CG counterparts. CONCLUSIONS PREDIMED-Plus intensive lifestyle intervention for 12 months was effective in decreasing adiposity and improving cardiovascular risk factors in overweight/obese older adults with metabolic syndrome, as well as in individuals with or at risk for diabetes.},

@article{Wang2007,
	abstract = {Background: Recently, in a cross-sectional study of 201 children in Araihazar, Bangladesh, exposure to arsenic (As) in drinking water has been shown to lower the scores on tests that measure children's intellectual function before and after adjustment for sociodemographic features. Objectives: We investigated the effects of As and fluoride exposure on children's intelligence and growth. Methods: We report the results of a study of 720 children between 8 and 12 years of age in rural villages in Shanyin county, Shanxi province, China. The children were exposed to As at concentrations of 142 $\pm$ 106 $\mu$g/L (medium-As group) and 190 $\pm$ 183 $\mu$g/L (high-As group) in drinking water compared with the control group that was exposed to low concentrations of As (2 $\pm$ 3 $\mu$g/L) and low concentrations of fluoride (0.5 $\pm$ 0.2 mg/L). A study group of children exposed to high concentrations of fluoride (8.3 $\pm$ 1.9 mg/L) but low concentrations of As (3 $\pm$ 3 $\mu$g/L) was also included because of the common occurrence of elevated concentrations of fluoride in groundwater in our study area. A standardized IQ (intelligence quotient) test was modified for children in rural China and was based on the classic Raven's test used to determine the effects of these exposures on children's intelligence. A standardized measurement procedure for weight, height, chest circumference, and lung capacity was used to determine the effects of these exposures on children's growth. Results: The mean IQ scores decreased from 105 $\pm$ 15 for the control group, to 101 $\pm$ 16 for the medium-As group (p {\textless} 0.05), and to 95 $\pm$ 17 for the high-As group (p {\textless} 0.01). The mean IQ score for the high-fluoride group was 101 $\pm$ 16 and significantly different from that of the control group (p {\textless} 0.05). Children in the control group were taller than those in the high-fluoride group (p {\textless} 0.05); weighed more than the those in the high-As group (p {\textless} 0.05); and had higher lung capacity than those in the medium-As group (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: Children's intelligence and growth can be affected by high concentrations of As or fluoride. The IQ scores of the children in the high-As group were the lowest among the four groups we investigated. It is more significant that high concentrations of As affect children's intelligence. It indicates that arsenic exposure can affect children's intelligence and growth.},

@article{Norton2010,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice grains is a risk to human health. The mechanism of transfer of As from the shoot into the grain during grain filling is unknown at present. In this study As speciation in the shoot and grains at maturity were examined, and the relationships between phosphorus (P) and As, and silicon (Si) and As were established in a wide range of cultivars grown in As contaminated field trials in Bangladesh and China. No correlations were observed between shoot and grain speciation, with the inorganic form comprising 93.0-97.0{\%} of As in the shoot and 63.0-83.7{\%} in the grains. The percentage of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was between 1.4 and 6.6{\%} in the shoot and 14.6 and 37.0{\%} in the grains; however, the concentrations were comparable, ranging from 0.07 to 0.26 mg kg(-1) in the shoots and 0.03 to 0.25 mg kg(-1) in the grains. A positive correlation was observed between shoot As and shoot Si, however, no correlation was observed between shoot Si and grain As. A significant negative correlation was observed between shoot P and grain As concentrations. These results suggest that the translocation of As into the grain from the shoots is potentially using P rather than Si transport mechanisms. The findings also indicate that inorganic As and DMA translocation to the grain differ considerably.},

@article{Heinrich-Ramm2002,
	abstract = {Influence of controlled consumption of marine fish on the urinary excretion of arsenite, arsenate, dimethylarsinic and monomethylarsonic acid (DMA, MMA) was investigated in two experiments. Arsenic species were separated by anion-exchange chromatography and detected with hydride-technique atomic absorption spectrometry (detection limit 1, 10, 2, 2 $\mu$g/l). Firstly, 13 probands ate different types of seafood after having refrained from any seafood for 1 week. DMA levels rose from 3.4$\pm$1.3 $\mu$g/g creatinine (n=12; a day before seafood) to a mean peak level of 28.2$\pm$20.6 $\mu$g/g (n=13; 10-23 h after; P{\textless}0.001; max. 77.7 $\mu$g/g). No other species were excreted before the meal, but small amounts of arsenite (8.5{\%} positive; max. 1.7 $\mu$g/g) and MMA (1.2{\%}; 1.6 $\mu$g/g) within 2 days after it (n=82). Consumption of white herring caused the highest DMA levels. Secondly, eight probands ingested white herring (dose 3.5 g/kg; DMA content 32.1$\pm$15.3 ng/g wet weight; n=36). No arsenite, arsenate and MMA was found in the urine or in the herring tissues. The mean DMA mass excreted after the meal (65.3$\pm$22.0 $\mu$g/24 h) was about 6-fold higher than the sum of base DMA excretion (3.0$\pm$1.7 $\mu$g/24 h) and the ingested DMA mass (7.9$\pm$2.7 $\mu$g). This indicates that the elevated DMA excretion after herring consumption is not caused by the metabolism of inorganic arsenic but of other arsenic species present in the fish tissue, e.g. arsenobetaine or fat-soluble arsenic species. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {Background: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent chemicals that have been widely used as flame retardants in furniture, carpet padding, car seats, and other consumer products during the past three decades. Objective: We examined whether in utero exposure to PBDEs is associated with child cognitive function and behavior in a U.S. study sample. Methods: In a prospective birth cohort, we measured maternal serum concentrations of BDE-47 and other PBDE congeners in 309 women at 16 weeks of gestation during 2003-2006 and followed their children in Cincinnati, Ohio. We measured cognitive and motor abilities using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II at ages 1, 2, and 3 years; intelligence using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III at age 5 years; and children's behaviors using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 annually at ages 2-5 years. We used linear mixed models or generalized estimating equations with adjustment for potential confounders to estimate associations between these outcomes and log10-transformed PBDE concentrations. Results: The geometric mean of BDE-47 in maternal serum (20.1 ng/g lipid) was comparable with U.S. adult national reference values. Prenatal BDE-47 was not significantly associated with Bayley Mental or Psychomotor Development Indices at 1-3 years, but a 10-fold increase in prenatal BDE-47 was associated with a 4.5-point decrease (95{\%} CI: -8.8, -0.1) in Full-Scale IQ and a 3.3-point increase (95{\%} CI: 0.3, 6.3) in the hyperactivity score at age 5 years. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PBDEs was associated with lower IQ and higher hyperactivity scores in children.},

In metallomics, metalloproteins, metalloenzymes and other metal- containing biomolecules are defined as "metallomes", in a similar manner to genomes in genomics as well as proteomes in proteomics. Since the identification of metallomes and the elucidation of their biological or physiological functions in the biological systems is the main research target of metallomics, chemical speciation for specific identification of bioactive metallomes is one of the most important analytical technologies to establish metallomics as the integrated bio-metal science. In order to rationalize the concept of metallomics, the distributions of the elements in man, human blood serum and sea-water, a challenge to all-elements analysis of one biological cell, and some other research topics are introduced with emphasis on recent development of chemical speciation of trace metals in some biological samples. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Chemistry 2004.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Little is known about the carcinogenic potential of arsenic in areas with low to moderate concentrations of arsenic ({\textless} 100 microg/L) in drinking water. OBJECTIVES We examined associations between arsenic and lung cancer. METHODS A population-based case-control study of primary incident lung cancer was conducted in 10 counties in two U.S. states, New Hampshire and Vermont. The study included 223 lung cancer cases and 238 controls, each of whom provided toenail clippings for arsenic exposure measurement by inductively coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) of the association between arsenic exposure and lung cancer using unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking pack-years, education, body mass index, fish servings per week, and toenail selenium level). RESULTS Arsenic exposure was associated with small-cell and squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung [OR = 2.75; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.00-7.57] for toenail arsenic concentration {\textgreater} or = 0.114 microg/g, versus {\textless} 0.05 microg/g. A history of lung disease (bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or fibrosis) was positively associated with lung cancer (OR = 2.86; 95{\%} CI, 1.39-5.91). We also observed an elevated risk of lung cancer among participants with a history of lung disease and toenail arsenic {\textgreater} or = 0.05 microg/g (OR = 4.78; 95{\%} CI, 1.87-12.2) than among individuals with low toenail arsenic and no history of lung disease. CONCLUSION Although this study supports the possibility of an increased risk of specific lung cancer histologic types at lower levels of arsenic exposure, we recommend large-scale population-based studies.},

The lack of animal models has hindered mechanistic studies of arsenic carcinogenesis in the past, but some promising new models for these cancers are now available. The various forms of arsenic to which humans are exposed, either directly or via metabolism of inorganic arsenic to various methylated forms, further complicate the issue of mechanism, since these compounds can have different effects, both genotoxic and non-genotoxic.

@article{Ismail2012,
	abstract = {Genetic polymorphism is defined as the inheritance of a trait controlled by a single genetic locus with two alleles, in which the least common allele has a frequency of about 1{\%} or greater. Genetic polymorphism is a difference in DNA sequence among individuals, groups, or populations. Sources include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), sequence repeats, insertions, deletions, and recombination. Genetic polymorphisms may be the result of chance processes or may have been induced by external agents such as viruses or radiation. If a difference in DNA sequence among individuals has been shown to be associated with disease, it will usually be called a genetic mutation. Changes in DNA sequence that have been confirmed to be caused by external agents are also generally called 'mutations' rather than 'polymorphisms'. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variations in humans. Understanding the functions of SNPs can greatly help us understand the genetics of human phenotype variation, especially the genetic basis of complex human diseases. DNA polymorphisms comprise three types: tandem repeat polymorphism, copy-number variations and SNPs. Detection of these polymorphisms can be carried out by different methods including allele-specific PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, the microarray technique, and whole genome sequencing. Calculation of the sample size is very important in studying any polymorphism using specific free software. Here we shed some light on DNA polymorphisms and their implications as genetic markers in polygenic diseases.},

	abstract = {In this prospective cohort study, based on 1,505 mother-infant pairs in rural Bangladesh, we evaluated the associations between early-life exposure to arsenic, cadmium, and lead, assessed via concentrations in maternal and child urine, and children's weights and heights up to age 5 years, during the period 2001-2009. Concurrent and prenatal exposures were evaluated using linear regression analysis, while longitudinal exposure was assessed using mixed-effects linear regression. An inverse association was found between children's weight and height, age-adjusted z scores, and growth velocity at age 5 years and concurrent exposure to cadmium and arsenic. In the longitudinal analysis, multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in children's weight at age 5 years were -0.33 kg (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): -0.60, -0.06) for high (≥95th percentile) arsenic exposure and -0.57 kg (95{\%} CI: -0.88, -0.26) for high cadmium exposure, in comparison with children with the lowest exposure (≤5th percentile). Multivariable-adjusted attributable differences in height were -0.50 cm (95{\%} CI: -1.20, 0.21) for high arsenic exposure and -1.6 cm (95{\%} CI: -2.4, -0.77) for high cadmium exposure. The associations were apparent primarily among girls. The negative effects on children's growth at age 5 years attributable to arsenic and cadmium were of similar magnitude to the difference between girls and boys in terms of weight (-0.67 kg, 95{\%} CI: -0.82, -0.53) and height (-1.3 cm, 95{\%} CI: -1.7, -0.89).},

	abstract = {Blood uric acid has been recognized as a putative marker for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are the major causes of arsenic-related morbidity and mortality. However, the association of arsenic exposure with plasma uric acid (PUA) levels in relation to CVDs has not yet been explored. This study for the first time demonstrated the associations of arsenic exposure with PUA levels and its relationship with hypertension. A total of 483 subjects, 322 from arsenic-endemic and 161 from non-endemic areas in Bangladesh were recruited as study subjects. Arsenic concentrations in the drinking water, hair and nails of the study subjects were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. PUA levels were measured using a colorimetric method. We found that PUA levels were significantly (p{\textless} 0.001) higher in males and females living in arsenic-endemic areas than those in non-endemic area. Arsenic exposure (water, hair and nail arsenic) levels showed significant positive correlations with PUA levels. In multiple regression analyses, arsenic exposure levels were found to be the most significant contributors on PUA levels among the other variables that included age, body mass index, blood urea nitrogen, and smoking. There were dose-response relationships between arsenic exposure and PUA levels. Furthermore, diastolic and systolic blood pressure showed significant positive correlations with PUA levels. Finally, the average PUA levels were significantly higher in the hypertensive group than those in the normotensive group in both males and females living in arsenic-endemic areas. These results suggest that arsenic exposure-related elevation of PUA levels may be implicated in arsenic-induced CVDs.},

	abstract = {Arsenic concentration in toenail clippings is used as a biomarker of exposure in epidemiological studies, often under the assumption that a single measurement represents long-term exposure. For this assumption to hold, the measured arsenic concentrations must be stable over time, yet temporal variability has not been adequately assessed. This study aims to evaluate temporal variability in multiple toenail samples collected from a population exposed to drinking water arsenic levels {\textless}100 microg/l. Our objectives are to investigate factors responsible for biomarker variability and to assess the suitability of single versus multiple measurements for determining exposure in epidemiological studies. Multiple toenail and drinking water samples were collected from 254 participants enrolled in a case-control study of arsenic exposure and bladder cancer in Michigan, USA; participants also answered questions on water consumption. Toenail samples collected an average of 14 months apart were positively correlated, although a substantial amount of variability was detected (r=0.43, P{\textless}0.0001, n=236). Arsenic concentration in drinking water was stable and small changes in drinking water arsenic concentration did not explain variability in toenail arsenic concentration. Change in drinking water consumption, however, was significant in predicting differences in toenail arsenic concentration. Stronger correlations between drinking water arsenic concentration and intake and toenail arsenic concentration were observed when two toenail samples were averaged, suggesting that multiple measurements may more accurately reflect exposure. When exposure was categorized into tertiles and other pre-determined categories, 25-40{\%} of exposures were differentially classified. Only a small percentage ({\textless}4{\%}), however, were classified as having low exposure using a single measurement and high exposure when an average of two measurements was used. These results suggest that the use of multiple measurements is unlikely to affect exposure classification of individuals into high- or low-exposure groups; however, collection of multiple samples may be advantageous for more refined exposure classification.},

	abstract = {Groundwater, the major source of drinking water in Bengal Delta Plain, is contaminated with geogenic arsenic (As)enrichment affecting millions of people. Children exposed to tubewell water containing As may be associated with thyroid dysfunction, which in turn may impact neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, data to support such relationship is sparse. The purpose of this study was to examine if chronic water As (WAs)from Holocene alluvial aquifers in this region was associated with serum thyroid hormone (TH)and if TH biomarkers were related to neurobehavioral (NB)performance in a group of adolescents. A sample of 32 healthy adolescents were randomly drawn from a child cohort in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS)in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Half of these participants were consistently exposed to low WAs ({\textless}10 $\mu$g/L)and the remaining half had high WAs exposure (≥10 $\mu$g/L)since birth. Measurements included serum total triiodothyronine (tT 3 ), free thyroxine (fT 4 ), thyrotropin (TSH)and thyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAb); concurrent WAs and urinary arsenic (UAs); and adolescents' NB performance. WAs and UAs were positively and significantly correlated with TPOAb but were not correlated with TSH, tT 3 and fT 4 . After accounting for covariates, both WAs and UAs demonstrated positive but non-significant relationships with TSH and TPOAb and negative but non-significant relationships with tT 3 and fT 4 . TPOAb was significantly associated with reduced NB performance indicated by positive associations with latencies in simple reaction time (b = 82.58; p {\textless} 0.001)and symbol digit (b = 276.85; p = 0.005)tests. TSH was significantly and negatively associated with match-to-sample correct count (b = −0.95; p = 0.05). Overall, we did not observe significant associations between arsenic exposure and TH biomarkers although the relationships were in the expected directions. We observed TH biomarkers to be related to reduced NB performance as hypothesized. Our study indicated a possible mechanism of As-induced neurotoxicity, which requires further investigations for confirmatory findings.},

	abstract = {Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick, objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to identify the most important terms for a review. The method reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used in published environmental systematic reviews, our method performs as well as the published searches and retrieves gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original searches do not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately 17--34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by automatically deduplicating and assembling results from separate databases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although covariate adjustment in the analysis of randomised trials can be beneficial, adjustment for continuous covariates is complicated by the fact that the association between covariate and outcome must be specified. Misspecification of this association can lead to reduced power, and potentially incorrect conclusions regarding treatment efficacy. METHODS: We compared several methods of adjustment to determine which is best when the association between covariate and outcome is unknown. We assessed (a) dichotomisation or categorisation; (b) assuming a linear association with outcome; (c) using fractional polynomials with one (FP1) or two (FP2) polynomial terms; and (d) using restricted cubic splines with 3 or 5 knots. We evaluated each method using simulation and through a re-analysis of trial datasets. RESULTS: Methods which kept covariates as continuous typically had higher power than methods which used categorisation. Dichotomisation, categorisation, and assuming a linear association all led to large reductions in power when the true association was non-linear. FP2 models and restricted cubic splines with 3 or 5 knots performed best overall. CONCLUSIONS: For the analysis of randomised trials we recommend (1) adjusting for continuous covariates even if their association with outcome is unknown; (2) keeping covariates as continuous; and (3) using fractional polynomials with two polynomial terms or restricted cubic splines with 3 to 5 knots when a linear association is in doubt.},

	abstract = {Surface soil and groundwater in Australia have been found to contain high concentrations of arsenic. The relative importance of long-term human exposure to these sources has not been established. Several studies have investigated long-term exposure to environmental arsenic concentrations using hair and toenails as the measure of exposure. Few have compared the difference in these measures of environmental sources of exposure. In this study we aimed to investigate risk factors for elevated hair and toenail arsenic concentrations in populations exposed to a range of environmental arsenic concentrations in both drinking water and soil as well as in a control population with low arsenic concentrations in both drinking water and soil. In this study, we recruited 153 participants from areas with elevated arsenic concentrations in drinking water and residential soil, as well as a control population with no anticipated arsenic exposures. The median drinking water arsenic concentrations in the exposed population were 43.8 micro g/L (range, 16.0-73 micro g/L) and median soil arsenic concentrations were 92.0 mg/kg (range, 9.1-9,900 mg/kg). In the control group, the median drinking water arsenic concentration was below the limit of detection, and the median soil arsenic concentration was 3.3 mg/kg. Participants were categorized based on household drinking water and residential soil arsenic concentrations. The geometric mean hair arsenic concentrations were 5.52 mg/kg for the drinking water exposure group and 3.31 mg/kg for the soil exposure group. The geometric mean toenail arsenic concentrations were 21.7 mg/kg for the drinking water exposure group and 32.1 mg/kg for the high-soil exposure group. Toenail arsenic concentrations were more strongly correlated with both drinking water and soil arsenic concentrations; however, there is a strong likelihood of significant external contamination. Measures of residential exposure were better predictors of hair and toenail arsenic concentrations than were local environmental concentrations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Arsenic is a known bladder carcinogen and populations exposed to high arsenic levels in their water supply have reported elevated bladder cancer mortality and incidence rates. To examine the effects of lower levels of arsenic exposure on bladder cancer incidence, we conducted a case-control study in New Hampshire, USA where levels above 10 micro/l are commonly found in private wells. METHODS: We studied 383 cases of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cancer, newly diagnosed between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1998 and 641 general population controls. Individual exposure to arsenic was determined in toenail clippings using instrumental neutron activation analysis. RESULTS: Among smokers, an elevated odds ratio (OR) for bladder cancer was observed for the uppermost category of arsenic (OR: 2.17, 95{\%} CI: 0.92-5.11 for greater than 0.330 mcg/g compared to less than 0.06 micro/g). Among never smokers, there was no association between arsenic and bladder cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: These, and other data, suggest that ingestion of low to moderate arsenic levels may affect bladder cancer incidence, and that cigarette smoking may act as a co-carcinogen.},

For high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breast-fed, hydrolyzed formula appears to offer advantages to prevent allergic disease and cow's milk allergy. Complementary foods can be introduced between 4 and 6 months of age. Because no formal recommendations have been previously provided about how and when to introduce the main allergenic foods (cow's milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish), these are now provided, and reasons to consider allergy consultation for development of a personalized plan for food introduction are also presented. ?? 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma {\&} Immunology.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Exposure to mixtures of environmental chemicals are prevalent among pregnant women and may be associated with altered fetal growth and gestational age. To date, most research regarding environmental chemicals and neonatal outcomes has focused on the effect of individual agents. Methods: In a prospective cohort of 380 pregnant women from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003--2006), we used biomarkers to estimate exposure to 43 phenols, phthalates, metals, organophosphate/pyrethroid/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and environmental tobacco smoke. Using three approaches, we estimated covariate-adjusted associations of chemical mixtures or individual chemicals with gestational-age-specific birth weight z-scores, birth length, head circumference, and gestational age: k-means clustering, principal components (PC), and one-chemical-at-a-time regression. Results: We identified three chemical mixture profiles using k-means clustering. Women in cluster 1 had higher concentrations of most phenols, three phthalate metabolites, several metals, organophosphate/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and several PFAS than women in clusters 2 and 3. On average, infants born to women in clusters 1 (−1.2 cm; 95{\%} CI: −1.9, −0.5) and 2 (−0.5 cm; 95{\%} CI: −1.1, 0.1) had lower birth length than infants in cluster 3. Six PCs explained 50{\%} of the variance in biomarker concentrations and biomarkers with similar chemical structures or from shared commercial/industrial settings loaded onto commons PCs. Each standard deviation increase in PC 1 (organochlorine pesticides, some phenols) and PC 6 (cadmium, bisphenol A) was associated with 0.2 cm (95{\%} CI: −0.4, 0.0) and 0.1 cm (95{\%} CI: −0.4, 0.1) lower birth length, respectively. Organochlorine compounds, parabens, and cadmium were inversely associated with birth length in the one-chemical-at-a-time analysis. Cluster membership, PC scores, and individual chemicals were not associated with other birth outcomes. Conclusion: All three methods of characterizing multiple chemical exposures in this cohort identified inverse associations of select organochlorine compounds, phenols, and cadmium with birth length, but not other neonatal outcomes.},

	abstract = {In the attempt to estimate the average concentration of a particular contaminant during some period of time, a certain proportion of the collected samples is often reported to be below the limit of detection. The statistical terminology for these resultsis known as censored data, i.e., nonzero values which cannot bemeasured but are known to be below some threshold. Samples taken over time are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. Given this assumption, several techniques are presented for estimation of the average concentration from datacontaining nondetectable values. The techniques proposed include three methods of estimation with a left-censored lognormaldistribution: a maximum likelihood statistical method and twomethods involving the limit of detection. Each method is evaluated using computer simulation with respect to the bias associated with estimation of the mean and standard deviation. Themaximum likelihood method was shown to produce unbiasedestimates of both the mean and standard deviation under a varietyof conditions. However, this method is somewhat complex andinvolves laborious calculations and use of tables. Two simpleralternatives involve the substitution of L/2 and a new proposalof I./V2 for each nondetectable value, where L = the limit ofdetection. The new method was shown to provide more accurateestimation of the mean and standard deviation than the L/2 methodwhen the data are not highly skewed. The L/2 method shouldbe used when the data are highly skewed (geometric standarddeviation [GSD] approximately 3.0 or greater. {\textcopyright} 1990 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

With these essential metals toxicity occurs when concentrations are either too low or too high. For some metals there are no physiological concentrations that are beneficial; as such these metals only have the potential to cause toxicity.

Heavy metals have extensive applications in industries, homes, agriculture and medicine, leading to their wide distribution in the environment. Most heavy metals are reported to be highly toxic. They also have numerous exposure routes, including ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption, subsequently inducing some health effects resulting from human and heavy metals contact. The implications of heavy metals with regards to children's health have been noted to be more severe compared to adults. The element's harmful consequences on children health include mental retardation, neurocognitive disorders, behavioral disorders, respiratory problems, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Much attention should be given to heavy metals because of their high toxicity potential, widespread use, and prevalence. This review therefore examines the exposure routes and health effects of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and barium (Ba) on children.

	abstract = {In order to investigate the transfer and accumulation pathways of heavy metals in cropland ecosystems, an investigation of the geochemical behaviors of heavy metals in soil and rice plants was carried out in the Yangtze River Delta. Soil is one of the biggest reservoirs of heavy metals and affects food safety at the beginning of the food chain. The results of this study demonstrate that heavy metal levels in soil decreased with increasing soil pH, while rice shoots accumulated heavy metals more readily under low soil pH conditions. The non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (HQ) of heavy metals show that health risks for humans were primarily due to Pb and As. Furthermore, cancer risk (Risk) results suggested that {\~{}}76{\%} and {\~{}}15.7{\%} of cancer risk was caused by Cd and As levels, respectively. Decreasing soil pH enhanced the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks for the human body. Through exponential change between transfer factor (TFgrain/soil) and soil metals, HQ, a direct monitoring method for rice plants, was built using regression curves. It is proposed that besides condition of soil with high heavy metal concentration, for rice grown with surface soil metals, the safety of the rice product should be monitored when soil metals are under the following levels after harvest: non-carcinogenic risk, As {\textless} 20 mg/kg, Pb {\textless} 100 mg/kg, Cd {\textless} 0.07--0.68 mg/kg and Cu 7.56--30.87 mg/kg; and cancer risk, As {\textless} 20 mg/kg, Cd {\textless} 4 mg/kg and Cr {\textless} 200 mg/kg.},

This prospective cohort study, based on 1,578 mother-infant pairs, was conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh, in 2002-2003. Arsenic exposure was assessed by analysis of arsenic in urine collected at around gestational weeks 8 and 30. The association of arsenic exposure with size at birth was assessed by linear regression analyses. In analysis over the full range of exposure (6-978 microg/L), no dose-effect association was found with birth size. However, significant negative dose effects were found with birth weight and head and chest circumferences at a low level of arsenic exposure ({\textless}100 microg/L in urine). In this range of exposure, birth weight decreased by 1.68 (standard error (SE), 0.62) g for each 1-microg/L increase of arsenic in urine. For head and chest circumferences, the corresponding reductions were 0.05 (SE, 0.03) mm and 0.14 (SE, 0.03) mm per 1 microg/L, respectively. No further negative effects were shown at higher levels of arsenic exposure. The indicated negative effect on birth size at a low level of arsenic exposure warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {Health maintenance organization (HMO) administrative databases have been used as sampling frames for ascertaining nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). However, because of the lack of tumor registry information on these cancers, these ascertainment methods have not been previously validated. NMSC cases arising from patients served by a staff model medical group and diagnosed between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2008 were identified from claims data using three ascertainment strategies. These claims data cases were then compared with NMSC identified using natural language processing (NLP) of electronic pathology reports (EPRs), and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Comparison of claims data-ascertained cases with the NLP demonstrated sensitivities ranging from 48 to 65{\%} and specificities from 85 to 98{\%}, with ICD-9-CM ascertainment demonstrating the highest case sensitivity, although the lowest specificity. HMO health plan claims data had a higher specificity than all-payer claims data. A comparison of EPR and clinic log registry cases showed a sensitivity of 98{\%} and a specificity of 99{\%}. Validation of administrative data to ascertain NMSC demonstrates respectable sensitivity and specificity, although NLP ascertainment was superior. There is a substantial difference in cases identified by NLP compared with claims data, suggesting that formal surveillance efforts should be considered.},

	abstract = {A trend towards earlier menarche in women has been associated with childhood factors (e.g. obesity) and hypothesised environmental exposures (e.g. endocrine disruptors present in household products). Observational evidence has shown detrimental effects of early menarche on various health outcomes including adult lung function, but these might represent spurious associations due to confounding. To address this we used Mendelian randomization where genetic variants are used as proxies for age at menarche, since genetic associations are not affected by classical confounding. We estimated the effects of age at menarche on forced vital capacity (FVC), a proxy for restrictive lung impairment, and ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to FVC (FEV1/FVC), a measure of airway obstruction, in both adulthood and adolescence. We derived SNP-age at menarche association estimates for 122 variants from a published genome-wide meta-analysis (N = 182,416), with SNP-lung function estimates obtained by meta-analysing three studies of adult women (N = 46,944) and two of adolescent girls (N = 3025). We investigated the impact of departures from the assumption of no pleiotropy through sensitivity analyses. In adult women, in line with previous evidence, we found an effect on restrictive lung impairment with a 24.8 mL increase in FVC per year increase in age at menarche (95{\%} CI 1.8--47.9; p = 0.035); evidence was stronger after excluding potential pleiotropic variants (43.6 mL; 17.2--69.9; p = 0.001). In adolescent girls we found an opposite effect (−56.5 mL; −108.3 to −4.7; p = 0.033), suggesting that the detrimental effect in adulthood may be preceded by a short-term post-pubertal benefit. Our secondary analyses showing results in the same direction in men and boys, in whom age at menarche SNPs have also shown association with sexual development, suggest a role for pubertal timing in general rather than menarche specifically. We found no effect on airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC).},

This question is not new and our field of epidemiology is far from alone in struggling with it. I have four suggestions for authors and 1 2,3 readers. The first is quite broad, so I offer that one before describing current practices. I then turn to the other three. My remarks are confined to settings in which P-values and confidence intervals accompany estimates of effect measures, such as the relative risk. Briefly, here are my suggestions. One, we should work harder than ever to avoid strict or exact interpretations of P- values and confidence intervals in observational research, where these statistics lack a theoretical basis. Two, we should stop interpreting P-values and confidence intervals as though they measure the probability of hypotheses. Three, when we want to know the probability of hypotheses, we should use Bayesian methods, which are designed expressly for that purpose. Four, we should get serious about precision and look for narrow confidence intervals instead of low P-values to identify results that are least influenced by random error.},

	abstract = {Objective: Spot urine samples were investigated to determine correlations between urinary creatinine and specific gravity, and intra- and inter-day variations other than gender- and age-dependence of urinary concentrations. Methods: Urinary creatinine concentrations and specific gravity were determined in 534 spot samples (385 from men and 149 from women). Subjects' ages ranged between 18 and 68 years. Spot urine samples were also collected from 14 male subjects before and after a 1-week work-shift for the evaluation of intra- and inter-day variations of creatinine and specific gravity. Results: In spot samples, creatinine concentrations ranged between 0.16 and 4.36 g/l and specific gravity between 1.002 and 1.037. A high correlation (r = 0.82, P {\textless} 0.001) was observed between creatinine and specific gravity; male subjects showed significantly higher values of creatinine (P {\textless} 0.001) than did females subjects (1.90 $\pm$ 0.74 and 1.41 $\pm$ 0.72 g/1, respectively) and specific gravity (1.023 $\pm$ 0.006 and 1.020 $\pm$ 0.007, respectively). In addition, creatinine but not specific gravity significantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.02) in subjects older than 50 years, compared with those under 40. Conclusions: Results confirm the gender-dependence of creatinine concentrations in spot specimens and also show age-dependence, indicating the need for these aspects to be considered when the range of acceptable samples is to be set. No significant intra- or inter-day variations were observed for the two parameters. Lastly, the possibility of a comparison of differently adjusted values was indicated by a conversion formula derived from adjustments to creatinine and the corresponding specific gravity of a hypothetical urinary value, as follows: specific gravity adjusted values = 1.48 × creatinine adjusted values.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is an established lung carcinogen, however, the carcinogenic mechanisms are currently under investigation. Phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported with arsenic exposure in bladder cells. EGFR is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor that regulates important processes in carcinogenesis, including cell survival, cell cycle progression, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis. We investigated the mechanisms of EGFR pathway activation by levels of arsenic relevant to human exposure scenarios both in vitro using cultured lung epithelial cells, and in lung tumors samples from New England Lung Cancer Study participants. Toenail arsenic levels were used as an internal biomarker of arsenic exposure. Our in vitro data suggest that arsenic increases levels of the EGFR ligand, heparin binding-EGF, and activate EGFR phosphorylation in the lung. Downstream of EGFR, arsenic exposure increased pERK and cyclin D1 levels. These effects were inhibited by treatment of cultured cells with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Tarceva (erlotinib). In a consecutive series of human lung tumor specimens, pEGFR protein levels were higher in subjects with elevated toenail arsenic levels compared to those with low exposure (odds ratio adjusted for other factors, OR 4.1 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.1-15.6) (p = 0.04). These data suggest that arsenic exposure may stimulate EGFR pathway activation in the lung. Moreover, the tumors that arise in arsenic-exposed individuals also exhibit signs of EGFR pathway dysregulation. Further work is needed to assess the clinical utility of targeting the EGFR pathway in subgroups of lung cancer patients who have been exposed to elevated levels of arsenic.},

Anthropogenic arsenic contamination of paddy soils exacerbates arsenic toxicity in rice crops resulting in substantial yield losses. Here, we report the identification of the gain-of-function arsenite tolerant 1 (astol1) mutant of rice that benefits from enhanced sulfur and selenium assimilation, arsenic tolerance, and decreased arsenic accumulation in grains. The astol1 mutation promotes the physical interaction of the chloroplast-localized O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase protein with its interaction partner serine-acetyltransferase in the cysteine synthase complex. Activation of the serine-acetyltransferase in this complex promotes the uptake of sulfate and selenium and enhances the production of cysteine, glutathione, and phytochelatins, resulting in increased tolerance and decreased translocation of arsenic to grains. Our findings uncover the pivotal sensing-function of the cysteine synthase complex in plastids for optimizing stress resilience and grain quality by regulating a fundamental macronutrient assimilation pathway.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The people of Bangladesh are currently exposed to high concentrations of arsenic and manganese in drinking water, as well as elevated lead in many regions. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between environmental exposure to these contaminants and neurodevelopmental outcomes among Bangladeshi children. METHODS We evaluated data from 524 children, members of an ongoing prospective birth cohort established to study the effects of prenatal and early childhood arsenic exposure in the Sirajdikhan and Pabna Districts of Bangladesh. Water was collected from the family's primary drinking source during the first trimester of pregnancy and at ages 1, 12 and 20-40 months. At age 20-40 months, blood lead was measured and neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using a translated, culturally-adapted version of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). RESULTS Median blood lead concentrations were higher in Sirajdikhan than Pabna (7.6 vs. {\textless}LOD$\mu$g/dL, p {\textless}0.0001) and water arsenic concentrations were lower (1.5 vs 25.7 $\mu$g/L, p {\textless}0.0001). Increased blood lead was associated with decreased cognitive scores in Sirajdikhan ($\beta$ = -0.17, SE = 0.09, p = 0.05), whereas increased water arsenic was associated with decreased cognitive scores in Pabna ($\beta$ = -0.06, SE = 0.03, p = 0.05). Water manganese was associated with fine motor scores in an inverse-U relationship in Pabna. CONCLUSION Where blood lead levels are high, lead is associated with decreased cognitive scores on the BSID-III, and effects of other metals are not detected. In the setting of lower lead levels, the adverse effects of arsenic and manganese on neurodevelopment are observed.},

	abstract = {Natural contamination of groundwater with arsenic (As) occurs around the$\backslash$nworld but is most widespread in the river basin deltas of South and$\backslash$nSoutheast Asia. Shallow groundwater is extensively used in the Bengal$\backslash$nbasin for irrigation of rice in the dry winter season, leading to the$\backslash$npossibility of As accumulation in soils, toxicity to rice and increased$\backslash$nlevels of As in rice grain and straw. The impact of As contaminated$\backslash$nirrigation water on soil-As content and rice productivity was studied$\backslash$nover two winter-season rice crops in the command area of a single$\backslash$ntubewell in Faridpur district, Bangladesh. After 16-17 years of use of$\backslash$nthe tubewell, a spatially variable build up of As and other chemical$\backslash$nconstituents of the water (Fe, Mn and P) was observed over the command$\backslash$narea, with soil-As levels ranging from about 10 to 70 mg kg(-1). A$\backslash$nsimple mass balance calculation using the current water As level of 0.13$\backslash$nmg As L(-1) suggested that 96{\%} of the added arsenic was retained in the$\backslash$nsoil. When BRRI dhan 29 rice was grown in two successive years across$\backslash$nthis soil-As gradient, yield declined progressively from 7-9 to 2-3 t$\backslash$nha(-1) with increasing soil-As concentration. The average yield loss$\backslash$nover the 8 ha command area was estimated to be 16{\%}. Rice-straw As$\backslash$ncontent increased with increasing soil-As concentration; however, the$\backslash$ntoxicity of As to rice resulted in reduced grain-As concentrations in$\backslash$none of the 2 years. The likelihood of As-induced yield reductions and As$\backslash$naccumulation in straw and grain has implications to agricultural$\backslash$nsustainability, food quality and food security in As-affected regions$\backslash$nthroughout South and Southeast Asia.},

	abstract = {The dietary requirement for an essential trace element is an intake level which meets a specified criterion for adequacy and thereby minimizes risk of nutrient deficiency or excess. Disturbances in trace element homeostasis may result in the development of pathologic states and diseases. This article is an update of a review article ``Trace Elements in Human Nutrition-A Review'' previously published in 2013. The previous review was updated to emphasis in detail the importance of known trace elements so far in humans' physiology and nutrition and also to implement the detailed information for practical and effective management of trace elements' status in clinical diagnosis and health care situations. Although various classifications for trace elements have been proposed and may be controversial, this review will use World Health Organization(WHO) classification as previously done. For this review a traditional integrated review format was chosen and many recent medical and scientific literatures for the new findings on bioavailability, functions, and state of excess/deficiency of trace elements were assessed. The results indicated that for the known essential elements, essentiality and toxicity are unrelated and toxicity is a matter of dose or exposure. Little is known about the essentiality of some of the probably essential elements. In regard to toxic heavy metals, a toxic element may nevertheless be essential. In addition, the early pathological manifestations of trace elements deficiency or excess are difficult to detect until more specific pathologically relevant indicators become available. Discoveries and many refinements in the development of new techniques and continual improvement in laboratory methods have enabled researchers to detect the early pathological consequences of deficiency or excess of trace elements. They all are promises to fulfill the gaps in the present and future research and clinical diagnosis of trace elements deficiencies or intoxications. However, further investigations are needed to complete the important gaps in our knowledge on trace elements, especially probably essential trace elements' role in health and disease status.},

@article{Fox2006,
	abstract = {Objectives: To examine average portion sizes consumed per eating occasion by infants and toddlers. Average portions reported for toddlers were compared to average portions for comparably aged children reported in the 1994 to 1996 and 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. In addition, reported average portions were compared with minimum required portion sizes for meals served to infants and toddlers in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). Design: Data from 24-hour recalls collected in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) were analyzed. Average portion sizes were determined for major food groups and individual foods that were reported by at least 5{\%} of the population. Most foods were reported separately; however, sandwiches were disaggregated into their components. Gram weights of portions consumed were converted, on a food-by-food basis, to household units so that foods with different volume-to-weight ratios could be analyzed together. Subjects/setting: A national random sample of 3,022 US infants and toddlers 4 to 24 months of age. Statistical analyses performed: For each food and food group, average portion sizes per eating occasion were computed for up to six age groups. An average per-eating occasion portion was determined for each child who consumed a given food by summing the total amount of food consumed over the day and dividing by the number of eating occasions. These estimates were then summed across all children who consumed the food and divided by the total number of consumers. The number of eating occasions was defined as the total number of times a child had anything to eat or drink during the day, excluding eating occasions that included only water and/or supplements. Results: For most foods, there was a gradual increase in the average portion as age increased. Average portions reported for FITS toddlers were consistent with those reported for comparably aged children in the most recent Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals. The average portions reported for FITS infants and toddlers were consistent with CACFP-recommended portion sizes for formula, juice, meats, and cheese. For milk (toddlers only), cereal, breads, fruits, and vegetables, average portions reported in FITS were consistently larger than CACFP portion sizes. Distributions showed that, in many cases, the per-eating occasion portion sizes of 50{\%} to 90{\%} of FITS infants and toddlers exceeded the CACFP portion sizes. Conclusions: Dietitians, pediatricians, and health educators can use the data presented in this article to provide guidance to parents and caregivers about reasonable portion sizes for infants and toddlers. The data should also be useful to those who plan meals for infants and toddlers in child care settings and to researchers studying dietary intakes of infants and toddlers. Advice about reasonable portion sizes should always be tempered with appropriate cautions about avoiding coercive "clean your plate" feeding practices. Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to offer infants and toddlers appropriate portions of healthful foods from the basic food groups, with a special emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and allow them to eat until they are satiated.

	abstract = {Diets that are high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains and include fish, nuts, and low-fat dairy products have protective health effects. The traditional Mediterranean diet encompasses these dietary characteristics. Other compounds of the Mediterranean diet, the antioxidants, which exist in abundance in vegetables, fruit, beverages, and also virgin olive oil, may contribute to the prevention of coronary heart disease and possibly several forms of cancer and other diseases, thus providing a plausible explanation for its apparent benefits. It may be misleading to focus on a single element of the diet; this may explain, at least in part, the disappointing and frustrating results obtained in trials with vitamin supplementation, prematurely thought to be "the magic bullet" for preventing a myriad of chronic diseases. The results of intervention studies aimed at evaluating whether Mediterranean-type diets are superior to classic diets in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease have all been encouraging. The biologic mechanisms by which these compounds might exert their effects include, among others, antioxidant functions and induction of detoxification enzymes. However, from a public health perspective it is not essential to wait for elucidation of every mechanism underlying health promotion activities and interventions; given the simplicity of the diet quality score, increasing the intake of recommended foods represents a practical recommendation for improving health. {\textcopyright} 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Manganese (Mn) is an essential mineral. It is present in virtually all diets at low concentrations. The principal route of intake for Mn is via food consumption, but in occupational cohorts, inhalation exposure may also occur (this subject will not be dealt with in this review). Humans maintain stable tissue levels of Mn. This is achieved via tight homeostatic control of both absorption and excretion. Nevertheless, it is well established that exposure to high oral, parenteral or ambient air concentrations of Mn can result in elevations in tissue Mn levels. Excessive Mn accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) is an established clinical entity, referred to as manganism. It resembles idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) in its clinical features, resulting in adverse neurological effects both in laboratory animals and humans. This review focuses on an area that to date has received little consideration, namely the potential exposure of parenterally fed neonates to exceedingly high Mn concentrations in parenteral nutrition solutions, potentially increasing their risk for Mn-induced adverse health sequelae. The review will consider (1) the essentiality of Mn; (2) the concentration ranges, means and variation of Mn in various foods and infant formulas; (3) the absorption, distribution, and elimination of Mn after oral exposure and (4) the factors that raise a theoretical concern that neonates receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are exposed to excessive dietary Mn. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is known to produce a variety of health problems, including peripheral neuropathy. Auditory, visual and somatosensory impairment have been reported in Mongolian farmers living in the Yellow River Valley, where drinking water is contaminated by arsenic. In the present study, sensory tests, including pinprick and vibration thresholds, were administered to 320 residents with well-water arsenic levels, ranging from non-detectable to 690 microg/L. Vibration thresholds in the second and fifth fingers of both hands were measured using a vibrothesiometer. Drinking water, urine and toenail samples were obtained to assess arsenic exposure and body burden. Regression analyses indicated significant associations of pinprick scores and vibration thresholds with all arsenic measures. Vibration thresholds were more strongly associated with urinary than water or nail arsenic measures, but odds ratios for decreased pinprick sensitivity were highest for the water arsenic measure. Results of the current study indicate neurosensory effects of arsenic exposure at concentrations well below the 1000 microg/L drinking water level specified by NRC, and suggest that non-carcinogenic end-points, such as vibration thresholds, are useful in the risk assessment of exposure to arsenic in drinking water.},

	abstract = {Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data visualization. Complementary to this, many scientists have called for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion. Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based. Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the desired `inference at a glance' nature of barplots and other similar visualization devices. These ``raincloud plots'' can visualize raw data, probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper, we provide basic demonstrations of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab ( https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots).

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Andrew2006,
	abstract = {The mechanism(s) by which arsenic exposure contributes to human cancer risk is unknown ; however, several indirect cocarcinogenesis mechanisms have been proposed. Many studies support the role of As in altering one or more DNA repair processes. In the present study we used individual-level exposure data and biologic samples to investigate the effects of As exposure on nucleotide excision repair in two study populations, focusing on the excision repair cross-complement 1 (ERCC1) component. We measured drinking water, urinary, or toenail As levels and obtained cryopreserved lymphocytes of a subset of individuals enrolled in epidemiologic studies in New Hampshire (USA) and Sonora (Mexico). Additionally, in corroborative laboratory studies, we examined the effects of As on DNA repair in a cultured human cell model. Arsenic exposure was associated with decreased expression of ERCC1 in isolated lymphocytes at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, lymphocytes from As-exposed individuals showed higher levels of DNA damage, as measured by a comet assay, both at baseline and after a 2-acetoxyacetylaminofluorene (2-AAAF) challenge. In support of the in vivo data, As exposure decreased ERCC1 mRNA expression and enhanced levels of DNA damage after a 2-AAAF challenge in cell culture. These data provide further evidence to support the ability of As to inhibit the DNA repair machinery, which is likely to enhance the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of other directly genotoxic compounds, as part of a cocarcinogenic mechanism of action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to arsenic (As), a human toxicant and carcinogen, remains a global public health problem. Health risks persist after As exposure has ended, suggesting epigenetic dysregulation as a mechanistic link between exposure and health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between total urinary As and locus-specific DNA methylation in the Strong Heart Study, a cohort of American Indian adults with low-to-moderate As exposure [total urinary As, formula presented creatinine: 11.7 (10.6)]. METHODS: DNA methylation was measured in 2,325 participants using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We implemented linear models to test differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and the DMRcate method to identify regions (DMRs) and conducted gene ontology enrichment analysis. Models were adjusted for estimated cell type proportions, age, sex, body mass index, smoking, education, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and study center. Arsenic was measured in urine as the sum of inorganic and methylated species. RESULTS: In adjusted models, methylation at 20 CpGs was associated with urinary As after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (formula presented ). After Bonferroni correction, 5 CpGs remained associated with total urinary As (formula presented ), located in SLC7A11, ANKS3, LINGO3, CSNK1D, ADAMTSL4. We identified one DMR on chromosome 11 (chr11:2,322,050-2,323,247), annotated to C11orf2; TSPAN32 genes. DISCUSSION: This is one of the first epigenome-wide association studies to investigate As exposure and locus-specific DNA methylation using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array and the largest epigenome-wide study of As exposure. The top DMP was located in SLC7A11A, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism. Further research is needed, including research in more diverse populations, to investigate whether As-related DNA methylation signatures are associated with gene expression or may serve as biomarkers of disease development. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6263.},

@article{Bandara2020,
	abstract = {Concerns have recently been raised about the presence of heavy metals in protein powder supplements following a Consumer Reports analysis of 15 protein powder products. The Consumer Reports study found that the average amounts of heavy metals in three servings of protein powder per day exceeded the maximum limits in dietary supplements proposed by U.S. Pharmacopeia. In a follow up to the Consumer Reports analysis, another study reported that 40 {\%} of the 133 protein powder products they tested had elevated levels of heavy metals. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether the heavy metal concentrations reported in protein powder supplements posed any human health risks, based on the reported concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb) in the protein powder. The US EPA reference doses (RfD) for As and Cd, and the EPA screening level for Hg were based on the most sensitive health endpoint which were used to calculate hazard quotients (HQs) for each metal. The `worse-case scenario' assessment for each protein powder product was expressed as a cumulative hazard index (HI), which is the sum of HQs from each heavy metal. Additionally, we utilized the U.S. EPA's Adult Lead Methodology (ALM) model to estimate adult blood lead levels (BLLs), which were compared to the CDC BLL guidance value of 5 $\mu$g/dL. All models assumed one or three servings of protein powder per day. Our results indicate that the exposure concentrations of the studied metals do not pose an increased health risk (Hazard Index {\textless} 1). We noted that the protein powder HI was mainly driven by the As or Cd content in each product. Interestingly, the highest HI levels (which approached 1) were found in `mass gain' type protein powder supplements, whereas the lowest calculated HI levels were in whey protein powders. Moreover, background Pb exposure was the primary contributor to estimated BLLs in adults, and all modeled BLLs were below 5 $\mu$g/dL. Overall, our results suggest that the typical intake of dietary supplements would not result in adverse health effects due to heavy metals.},

	abstract = {Methylation of arsenic in soil influences its environmental behavior and accumulation by plants, but little is known about the factors affecting As methylation. As speciation was determined in the pore waters of six soils from diverse geographical locations over 54 days of incubation under flooded conditions. The concentration of methylated As (monomethylarsonic acid, MMA, and dimethylarsinic acid, DMA) varied from 0 to 85 $\mu$g L-1 (0 the total As in pore water). Two Bangladeshi paddy soils contaminated by irrigation of As-laden groundwater produced large concentrations of inorganic As but relatively little methylated As. Two contaminated paddy soils from China produced a transient peak of DMA during the early phase of incubation. Methylated As represented considerable proportions of the total soluble As in the two uncontaminated soils from the UK and U.S. The copy number of the microbial arsenite methyltransferase gene (arsM) correlated positively with soil pH. However, pore-water methylated As correlated negatively with pH or arsM copy number, and positively with dissolved organic C. GeoChip assay revealed considerable arsM diversity among the six soils, with 27-35 out of 66 sequences in the microarray being detected. As speciation in rice plants grown in the soils generally mirrored that in the pore water. The results suggest that methylated As species in plants originated from the soil and As methylation in soil was influenced strongly by the soil conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Pacific population are at a disadvantage due to food insecurity as compared to New Zealand European households. This study aims to evaluate the status and interrelationship of elements (essential, non-essential and toxic) in nine-year-old Pacific children who were part of the Pacific Island Families Study living in New Zealand. Materials and Methods This observational study included 278 eligible nine-year-old children. Essential elements (including calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, zinc, molybdenum), non-essential and toxic elements (arsenic, aluminum, antimony, boron, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel,) were determined in toenails and after acid digestion, analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis and multivariate analysis of covariance was used to identify differences in the groups of elements and the inter-correlations between elements. Results The mean calcium (868 $\mu$g/g Ca), selenium (0.35 $\mu$g/g Se) and zinc (129 $\mu$g/g Zn) concentrations were lower while the mean cadmium (0.21 $\mu$g/g Cd) lead (0.86 $\mu$g/g Pb) and mercury (0.72 $\mu$g/g Hg) concentrations were higher than the optimal health requirements. Ethnic differences in relation to toenail elemental concentrations were observed for aluminium and iron. Gender differences were observed for aluminium, antimony, arsenic and lead. Selenium and molybdenum were inversely associated with mercury. Manganese, zinc and calcium were positively associated. Conclusions This research contributes to the understanding of the elemental concentrations for Pacific children by using tissue samples from toenails, which improves the completeness of sampling than other tissues and provides a longer exposure time frame. The study also reports several inter-correlations between essential, non-essential and toxic elements in Pacific Island population.},

	abstract = {Rice is elevated in arsenic (As) compared to other staple grains. The Bangladeshi community living in the United Kingdom (UK) has a ca. 30-fold higher consumption of rice than white Caucasians. In order to assess the impact of this difference in rice consumption, urinary arsenicals of 49 volunteers in the UK (Bangladeshi n = 37; white Caucasians n = 12) were monitored along with dietary habits. Total urinary arsenic (As(t)) and speciation analysis for dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MA) and inorganic arsenic (iAs) was conducted. Although no significant difference was found for As(t) (median: Bangladeshis 28.4 µg L(-1)) and white Caucasians (20.6 µg L(-1)), the sum of medians of DMA, MA and iAs for the Bangladeshi group was found to be over 3-fold higher (17.9 µg L(-1)) than for the Caucasians (3.50 µg L(-1)). Urinary DMA was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.001) in the UK Bangladeshis (median: 16.9 µg DMA L(-1)) than in the white Caucasians (3.16 µg DMA L(-1)) as well as iAs (p {\textless} 0.001) with a median of 0.630 µg iAs L(-1) for Bangladeshi and 0.250 µg iAs L(-1) for Caucasians. Cationic compounds were significantly lower in the Bangladeshis (2.93 µg L(-1)) than in Caucasians (14.9 µg L(-1)). The higher DMA and iAs levels in the Bangladeshis are mainly the result of higher rice consumption: arsenic is speciated in rice as both iAs and DMA, and iAs can be metabolized, through MA, to DMA by humans. This study shows that a higher dietary intake of DMA alters the DMA/MA ratio in urine. Consequently, DMA/MA ratio as an indication of methylation capacity in populations consuming large quantities of rice should be applied with caution since variation in the quantity and type of rice eaten may alter this ratio.},

To assess the validity and reliability of the HEI-2010, exemplary menus were scored and 2 24-h dietary recalls from individuals aged ≥2 y from the 2003-2004 NHANES were used to estimate multivariate usual intake distributions and assess whether the HEI-2010 1) has a distribution wide enough to detect meaningful differences in diet quality among individuals, 2) distinguishes between groups with known differences in diet quality by using t tests, 3) measures diet quality independently of energy intake by using Pearson correlation coefficients, 4) has {\textgreater}1 underlying dimension by using principal components analysis (PCA), and 5) is internally consistent by calculating Cronbach's coefficient $\alpha$. HEI-2010 scores were at or near the maximum levels for the exemplary menus. The distribution of scores among the population was wide (5th percentile = 31.7; 95th percentile = 70.4). As predicted, men's diet quality (mean HEI-2010 total score = 49.8) was poorer than women's (52.7), younger adults' diet quality (45.4) was poorer than older adults' (56.1), and smokers' diet quality (45.7) was poorer than nonsmokers' (53.3) (P {\textless} 0.01). Low correlations with energy were observed for HEI-2010 total and component scores (|r| ≤ 0.21). Cronbach's coefficient $\alpha$ was 0.68, supporting the reliability of the HEI-2010 total score as an indicator of overall diet quality. Nonetheless, PCA indicated multiple underlying dimensions, highlighting the fact that the component scores are equally as important as the total. A comparable reevaluation of the HEI-2005 yielded similar results. This study supports the validity and the reliability of both versions of the HEI.},

	abstract = {The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) list arsenic as a major concern for Superfund sites and the environment at large. Arsenic is clearly linked to skin, bladder, and lung cancer occurrence in populations highly exposed to arsenic occupationally, medicinally, or through contaminated drinking water (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1999; IARC, 1987). While these studies have identified important adverse health effects, they cannot provide risk information at lower levels of exposure such as those commonly found in the US. Additionally, precise measurement of exposure is critical to assessing risk in populations consuming relatively trace amounts of arsenic. In New Hampshire, domestic wells serve roughly 40{\%} of the population, and about 10{\%} of these contain arsenic concentrations in the controversial range of 10 to 50 micrograms/l. New Hampshire, along with other states in New England, has among the highest bladder cancer mortality rates in the country. Therefore, we are conducting a population-based epidemiologic study in New Hampshire (1) to assess the risk of skin and bladder cancer associated with arsenic exposure in a US population, (2) to evaluate methods of quantifying individual exposure to arsenic at low to moderate levels, and (3) to explore alternative models of determining the dose-response relationship at the lower end of exposure. Our findings to date indicate that toenail arsenic concentrations are a reliable, long-term biomarker of total arsenic exposure and reflect arsenic intake by drinking water containing 1 microgram/l or more. We found that urinary arsenic cannot be detected consistently in a population for which drinking water arsenic is primarily below 50 micrograms/l. Lastly, our data suggest that use of a biologic marker along with alternative statistical approaches may aid detection of the levels at which arsenic may affect cancer occurrence in the US.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may affect body mass index (BMI) and other components of cardiometabolic (CM) risk during childhood, but evidence is scarce and inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We estimated associations between prenatal PFAS exposures and outcomes relevant to cardiometabolic risk, including a composite CM-risk score. METHODS: We measured perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoro-nonanoic acid (PFNA) in maternal plasma (first trimester). We assessed weight gain from birth until 6 mo. At 4 and 7 y, we calculated the age- and sex-specific z-scores for BMI, waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure (BP) (n ≈ 1,000). At age 4, we calculated the age-, sex-, and region-specific z-scores for cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), high-density (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (n = 627). At age 4, we calculated a CM-risk score (n = 386) as the sum of the individual age-, sex-, and region-specific z-scores for WC, BP, HDL-C, and TGs. We used the average between the negative of HDL-C z-score and TGs z-score to give similar weight to lipids and the other components in the score. A higher score indicates a higher cardiometabolic risk at age 4. RESULTS: PFOS and PFOA were the most abundant PFAS (geometric mean: 5.80 and 2:32 ng/mL, respectively). In general, prenatal PFAS concentrations were not associated with individual outcomes or the combined CM-risk score. Exceptions were positive associations between prenatal PFHxS and TGs z-score [for a doubling of exposure, $\beta$ =0:11; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.01, 0.21], and between PFNA and the CM-risk score ($\beta$ =0:60; 95{\%} CI: 0.04, 1.16). There was not clear or consistent evidence of modification by sex. CONCLUSIONS: We observed little or no evidence of associations between low prenatal PFAS exposures and outcomes related to cardiometabolic risk in a cohort of Spanish children followed from birth until 7 y.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater drinking sources was investigated in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam in order to assess the occurrence of As in the groundwater, and the magnitude of As exposure of local residents through measurements of As in toenails of residents consuming groundwater as their major drinking water source. Groundwater (n = 68) and toenail (n = 62) samples were collected in Dong Thap Province, adjacent to the Mekong River, in southern Vietnam. Fifty-three percent (n = 36) of the wells tested had As content above the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended limit of 10. ppb. Samples were divided into Northern (mean As = 4.0. ppb) and Southern (329.0. ppb) groups; wells from the Southern group were located closer to the Mekong River. Elevated As contents were associated with depth ({\textless} 200 m), salinity (low salinity), and redox state (reducing conditions) of the study groundwater. In 79{\%} of the wells, As was primarily composed of the reduced As(III) species. Arsenic content in nails collected from local residents was significantly correlated to As in drinking water (r = 0.49, p {\textless} 0.001), and the relationship improved for pairs in which As in drinking water was higher than 1. ppb (r = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001). Survey data show that the ratio of As in nail to As in water varied among residents, reflecting differential As bioaccumulation in specific exposed sub-populations. The data show that water filtration and diet, particularly increased consumption of animal protein and dairy, and reduced consumption of seafood, were associated with lower ratios of As in nail to As in water and thus could play important roles in mitigating As exposure in areas where As-rich groundwater is the primary drinking water source.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with antimicrobial properties that  can be found in food and drinking water. The influence of arsenic exposure on the composition of the human microbiome in US populations remains unknown, particularly during the vulnerable infant period. We investigated the relationship between arsenic exposure and gut microbiome composition in 204 infants prospectively followed as part of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Infant urine was analyzed for total arsenic concentration using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Stool microbiome composition was determined using sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Infant urinary arsenic related to gut microbiome composition at 6 weeks of life (p = 0.05, adjusted for infant feeding type and urine specific gravity). Eight genera, six within the phylum Firmicutes, were enriched with higher arsenic exposure. Fifteen genera were negatively associated with urinary arsenic concentration, including Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Upon stratification by both sex and feeding method, we found detectable associations among formula-fed males (p = 0.008), but not other groups (p {\textgreater} 0.05 for formula-fed females and for breastfed males and females). Our findings from a US population indicate that even moderate arsenic exposure may have meaningful, sex-specific effects on the gut microbiome during a critical window of infant development.},

	abstract = {For much of the world's population, food is the major source of exposure to arsenic. Exposure to this non-essential metalloid at relatively low levels may be linked to a wide range of adverse health effects. Thus, evaluating foods as sources of exposure to arsenic is important in assessing risk and developing strategies that protect public health. Although most emphasis has been placed on inorganic arsenic as human carcinogen and toxicant, an array of arsenic-containing species are found in plants and animals used as foods. Here, we 2evaluate the contribution of complex organic arsenicals (arsenosugars, arsenolipids, and trimethylarsonium compounds) that are found in foods and consider their origins, metabolism, and potential toxicity. Commonalities in the metabolism of arsenosugars and arsenolipids lead to the production of di-methylated arsenicals which are known to exert many toxic effects. Evaluating foods as sources of exposure to these complex organic arsenicals and understanding the formation of reactive metabolites may be critical in assessing their contribution to aggregate exposure to arsenic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The uterine environment may be important for the chromosomal telomere length (TL) at birth, which, in turn, influences disease susceptibility throughout life. However, little is known about the importance of specific nutritional factors. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of multiple maternal nutritional factors on TL in placenta and cord blood. METHODS: In a population-based mother-child cohort in northwestern Argentina, we measured maternal weight, BMI, body fat percentage (BFP), and several nutrients [selenium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, manganese, iodine, vitamin B-12, folate, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3)], hemoglobin, and homocysteine in maternal whole blood, serum, plasma, or urine during pregnancy (mean gestational week 27). We measured the relative TL (rTL) in placenta (n = 99) and cord blood (n = 98) at delivery by real-time PCR. Associations were evaluated by multivariable-adjusted linear regression. RESULTS: The women's prepregnancy BMI (kg/m2; mean $\pm$ SD: 23.7 $\pm$ 4.1), body weight (55.4 $\pm$ 9.9 kg), and BFP (29.9 $\pm$ 5.5{\%}), but not height (153 $\pm$ 5.3 cm), were inversely associated with placental rTL (P {\textless} 0.01 for all), with ∼0.5 SD shorter rTL for an IQR increase in prepregnancy body weight, BMI, or BFP. Also, impedance-based BFP, but not lean body mass, in the third trimester was associated with shorter placental rTL. In addition, serum vitamin B-12 (232 $\pm$ 96 pmol/L) in pregnancy (P = 0.038), but not folate or homocysteine, was associated with shorter placental rTL (0.2 SD for an IQR increase). In contrast, plasma 25(OH)D3 (46 $\pm$ 15 nmol/L) was positively associated with placental rTL (P {\textless} 0.01), which increased by 0.4 SD for an IQR increase in 25(OH)D3. No clear associations of the studied maternal nutritional factors were found with cord blood rTL. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal BMI, BFP, and vitamin B-12 were positively associated, whereas 25(OH)D3 was inversely associated, with placental TL. No association was observed with cord blood TL. Future studies should elucidate the role of placental TL for child health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE - Cardiovascular fitness (VO2max) and physical activity are both related to risk of metabolic disease. It is unclear, however, whether the metabolic effects of sedentary living are the same in fit and unfit individuals. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to describe the association between physical activity and the metabolic syndrome and to test whether fitness level modifies this relationship. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Physical activity was measured objectively using individually calibrated heart rate against energy expenditure. VO2max was predicted from a submaximal exercise stress test. Fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) were calculated using impedance biometry. A metabolic syndrome score was computed by summing the standardized values for obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, and the inverse level of HDL cholesterol and was expressed as a continuously distributed outcome. To correct for exposure measurement error, a random subsample (22{\%} of cohort) re-attended for three repeat measurements in the year following the first assessment. RESULTS - The relationship of VO2max (ml O2 {\textperiodcentered} kgFFM-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1) and the metabolic syndrome score was of borderline significance after adjusting for age, sex, physical activity, and measurement error ($\beta$ = -0.58, P = 0.06). The magnitude of the association between physical activity (kJ {\textperiodcentered} d -1 {\textperiodcentered} kgFFM-1) and the metabolic syndrome was more than three times greater than for VO2max (standardized $\beta$ = -1.83, P = 0.0042). VO2max, however, modified the relationship between physical activity energy expenditure and metabolic syndrome (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS - This study demonstrates a strong inverse association between physical activity and metabolic syndrome, an association that is much steeper in unfit individuals. Thus, prevention of metabolic disease may be most effective in the subset of unfit inactive people.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved. Arsenic crosses the placenta and may have adverse consequences in utero and later in life. At present, little is known about arsenic concentrations in placenta and their relation to maternal and infant exposures particularly at common levels of exposure. We measured placenta arsenic in a US cohort potentially exposed via drinking water from private wells, and evaluated the relationships between placenta and maternal and infant biomarker arsenic concentrations. We measured total arsenic concentrations in placental samples from women enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (N=766). We compared these data to maternal urinary arsenic (total arsenic and individual species) collected at approximately 24-28 week gestation, along with maternal post-partum toenails and infant toenails using non-parametric multivariate analysis of log 10-transformed data. We also examined the association between placental arsenic and household drinking water arsenic. Placenta arsenic concentrations were related to arsenic concentrations in maternal urine ($\beta$ 0.55, P value {\textless} 0.0001), maternal ($\beta$ 0.30, P value 0.0196) and infant toenails ($\beta$ 0.40, P value 0.0293) and household drinking water ($\beta$ 0.09, P value {\textless} 0.0001). Thus, our data suggest that placenta arsenic concentrations reflect both maternal and infant exposures.},

	abstract = {Italy is the most important European country in terms of paddy rice production. North Italian districts such as Vercelli, Pavia, Novara, and Milano are known as some of the world's most advanced rice cultivation sites. In 2013 Italian rice cultivation represented about 50{\%} of all European rice production by area, and paddy fields extended for over 216,000 ha. Cultivation of rice involves different agricultural activities which have environmental impacts mainly due to fossil fuels and agrochemical requirements as well as the methane emission associated with the fermentation of organic material in the flooded rice fields. In order to assess the environmental consequences of rice production in the District of Vercelli, the cultivation practices most frequently carried out were inventoried and evaluated. The general approach of this study was not only to gather the inventory data for rice production and quantify their environmental impacts, but also to identify the key environmental factors where special attention must be paid. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was applied in this study from a cradle-to-farm gate perspective. The environmental profile was analyzed in terms of seven different impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and fossil depletion. Regarding straw management, two different scenarios (burial into the soil of the straw versus harvesting) were compared. The analysis showed that the environmental impact was mainly due to field emissions, the fuel consumption needed for the mechanization of field operations, and the drying of the paddy rice. The comparison between the two scenarios highlighted that the collection of the straw improves the environmental performance of rice production except that for freshwater eutrophication. To improve the environmental performance of rice production, solutions to save fossil fuel and reduce the emissions from fertilizers (leaching, volatilization) as well as methane emissions should be implemented.},

	abstract = {7,8 This case--control study identified the association between the arsenic methylation capacity and developmental delays and explored the association of this capacity with the health status of children. We recruited 120 children with developmental delays and 120 age-and sex-matched children without developmental delays. The health status of the children was assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). The arsenic methylation capacity was determined by the percentages of inorganic arsenic (InAs{\%}), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA V {\%}), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA V {\%}) through liquid chromatography and hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. Developmental delays were significantly positively associated with the total urinary arsenic concentration, InAs{\%}, and MMA V {\%}, and was significantly negatively associated with DMA V {\%} in a dose-dependent manner. MMA V {\%} was negatively associated with the health-related quality of life (HRQOL; −1.19 to −1.46, P {\textless} 0.01) and functional performance (−0.82 to −1.14, P {\textless} 0.01), whereas DMA V {\%} was positively associated with HRQOL (0.33--0.35, P {\textless} 0.05) and functional performance (0.21--0.39, P {\textless} 0.01--0.05) in all children and in those with developmental delays. The arsenic methylation capacity is dose-dependently associated with developmental delays and with the health status of children, particularly those with developmental delays. Exposure to environmental toxicants can affect health, particularly that of foetuses, infants, and children, during the sensitive and vulnerable early developmental and growth stages. Among heavy metals, arsenic is consid-ered the most hazardous and toxic contaminant originating from environmental, medicinal, and occupational sources},

	abstract = {Celiac disease (CD) may affect up to 1{\%} of the Western population. It is a disease whose diagnosis has been made mainly in childhood, but now the profile has changed, with one out of five newly diagnosed individuals being over 65 years old. The only treatment for this population is a gluten-free diet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyse the occurrence of arsenic (As) in gluten-free products, basically those rice-based, intended for celiac adult consumers. The current study demonstrated that these rice-based products contained important contents of total arsenic (t-As) (up to 120 $\mu$g kg(-1)) and inorganic arsenic (i-As) (up to 85.8 $\mu$g kg(-1)). It was estimated that the contents of t-As and i-As in rice used as the main ingredient of these foods were as high as 235 and 198 $\mu$g kg(-1), respectively. The estimated daily intake of i-As was 0.46 and 0.45 $\mu$g kg(-1) bw in women and men of 58 and 75 kg of body weight (bw), respectively. These values indicate that a health risk to these consumers cannot be excluded. Finally, legislation is needed to delimit the safety intake by health agencies and to improve the labelling of these special rice-based foods for celiac adult consumers. The label should include information about percentage, geographical origin and cultivar of the rice used; besides and if companies want to clearly prove the safety of their products, the exact content of i-As should also be included.},

	abstract = {While both the 2012 and 2014 Consumer Reports concerned arsenic levels in US rice, no previous study has evaluated long-term consumption of total rice, white rice and brown rice in relation to risk of developing cancers. We investigated this in the female Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010), and Nurses' Health Study II (1989-2009), and the male Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2008), which included a total of 45,231 men and 160,408 women, free of cancer at baseline. Validated food frequency questionnaires were used to measure rice consumption at baseline and repeated almost every 4 years thereafter. We employed Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate multivariable relative risks (RRs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CIs). During up to 26 years of follow-up, we documented 31,655 incident cancer cases (10,833 in men and 20,822 in women). Age-adjusted results were similar to multivariable-adjusted results. Compared to participants with less than one serving per week, the multivariable RRs of overall cancer for individuals who ate at least five servings per week were 0.97 for total rice (95{\%} CI: 0.85-1.07), 0.87 for white rice (95{\%} CI: 0.75-1.01), and 1.17 for brown rice (95{\%} CI: 0.90-1.26). Similar non-significant associations were observed for specific sites of cancers including prostate, breast, colon and rectum, melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung. Additionally, the null associations were observed among European Americans and non-smokers, and were not modified by BMI. Long-term consumption of total rice, white rice or brown rice was not associated with risk of developing cancer in US men and women. What's new? Although rice consumption per capita in the United States is low compared to Asian countries, the various types of rice eaten in the United States may contain elevated levels of arsenic, raising health concerns. This report explores possible relationships between rice consumption and cancer development. Analyses of data from the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study show that among U.S. men and women, neither total rice consumption nor white rice or brown rice consumption are associated with cancer. Measures of arsenic should be assessed in the context of rice consumption in future research. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 UICC.},

@article{Dorea2009,
	abstract = {The success of vaccination programs in reducing and eliminating infectious diseases has contributed to an ever-increasing number of vaccines given at earlier ages (newborns and infants). Exposure to low levels of environmental toxic substances (including metals) at an early age raises plausible concerns over increasingly lower neuro-cognitive rates. Current immunization schedules with vaccines containing aluminum (as adjuvant) are given to infants, but thimerosal (as preservative) is found mostly in vaccines used in non-industrialized countries. Exclusively, breastfed infants (in Brazil) receiving a full recommended schedule of immunizations showed an exceedingly high exposure of Al (225 to 1750 g per dose) when compared with estimated levels absorbed from breast milk (2.0 g). This study does not dispute the safety of vaccines but reinforces the need to study long-term effects of early exposure to neuro-toxic substances on the developing brain. Pragmatic vaccine safety needs to embrace conventional toxicology, addressing especial characteristics of unborn fetuses, neonates and infants exposed to low levels of aluminum, and ethylmercury traditionally considered innocuous to the central nervous system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Nature America, Inc.

	abstract = {Environmental Health Perspectives * volume 120 | number 1 | January 2012 127 pregnancy (n = 462) or at delivery (n = 462) from 1997 through 2000 in a larger study examining plasma lead biomarkers during pregnancy and neurodevelopment in Mexico City (Surkan et al. 2008; Tellez-Rojo et al. 2006). For the present study, we included 493 children who provided a blood sample at 12 and/or 24 months of age (12 months, n = 301; 24 months, n = 482) and underwent neuro developmental testing. Children were followed through 36 months of age. The par-ent study for this project did not include mea-sures of blood manganese, but whole blood was archived during follow-up visits whenever possible. After exclusions [e.g., very low birth weight ({\textless} 1,500 g), severely premature birth ({\textless} 32 weeks gestation), or missing data on gesta-tional age], 486 children (12 months, n = 296; 24 months, n = 475) met eligibility criteria. Eligible mothers were informed about the study, and written consent was obtained before participation. The human subjects committees of the National Institute of Public Health of Mexico, Harvard School of Public Health, and participating hospitals approved all study materials and procedures. Measurement of blood manganese and lead. Venous whole blood samples were col-lected in trace metal-free tubes from children at 12 and/or 24 months of age and immedi-ately frozen. We prepared and analyzed sam-ples for manganese and lead concentrations at the Trace Metals Laboratory at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. We meas-ured metals concentrations with a dynamic reaction cell/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Elan 6100; PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT, USA), using previously described methods and quality control mea-sures (Zota et al. 2009). Recovery rates for manganese and lead in quality control and spiked samples were 78--113{\%}, and preci-sion (percent relative standard deviation) was {\textless} 5{\%}. The average limits of detection were 0.09 and 0.04 $\mu$g/dL for manganese and lead, respectively, and all samples were above the limits of detection. Measurement of child development and potential confounders. We assessed child neuro-development at 6-month intervals (i.e., 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months of age) using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development--II, Spanish ver-sion (BSID-IIS) (Bayley 1993). Trained study personnel, who were blinded to children's manganese and lead levels, administered the test using a standardized protocol previously described by our research group (Gomaa et al. 2002). In this study, we considered scores from the Mental Development Index (MDI) and the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the BSID-IIS as the primary outcomes. We collected information on demo-graphic, socioeconomic, and other factors that could confound the relationship between manganese--lead and neurodevelopment: sex, hemoglobin at 12 and 24 months, ferritin at 12 and 24 months, birth weight, birth length, head circumference at birth, gestational age, maternal age at delivery, maternal and pater-nal education, maternal marital status at enrollment, duration of breast-feeding in the infant's first year, and child nutrition at 12 and 24 months collected via questionnaires. Umbilical cord blood lead and maternal blood lead at 1-month postpartum were also con-sidered as confounders, in order to examine effects of metals at 12 and 24 months inde-pendently from effects of exposures at birth. We assessed maternal IQ using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Spanish version (Wechsler 1968). Statistical analyses. Our previous analysis of the main effect of manganese suggested an inverted U-shaped association between man-ganese and neurodevelopment at 12 months, whereby lower MDI scores were observed at the lowest and highest quintiles of the man-ganese distribution compared with midrange levels of manganese (Claus Henn et al. 2010). We therefore examined the manganese--lead interaction at both the lowest and highest manganese quintiles (i.e., highest quintile manganese × lead and lowest quintile manga-nese × lead, compared with middle manganese quintiles). We modeled lead as a continuous variable, centered at the arithmetic mean value of the distribution. Although manganese and lead data were moderately skewed, the Gauss-- Markov model requires that only the model residuals be normally distributed. Because this assumption was satisfied, we did not log transform the exposure variables. Skewness may also arise from the presence of outliers; the influence of identified outliers on effect estimates was examined in sensitivity analyses, as described below. Neurodevelopment scores were approximately normally distributed and were modeled as continuous outcomes. We fit two (i.e., one for each exposure time point) linear mixed-effects models with repeated measures of Bayley scores to examine the manganese--lead interaction over time. Additionally, we fit separate adjusted regres-sion models for each exposure time point with each Bayley assessment (i.e., 12-month blood metals with 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, and 36-month Bayley scores; 24-month blood metals with 24-, 30-, and 36-month Bayley scores). We adjusted all models for the same set of covari-ates described previously (Claus Henn et al. 2010): sex, hemoglobin (grams per deciliter; modeled as continuous variable), gestational age (weeks; continuous variable), maternal IQ (continuous variable), and maternal educa-tion (years; continuous variable). We included known predictors of neurodevelopment or strong potential confounders (sex, maternal IQ, and education) a priori in multivariable regression models, based on biological plau-sibility. To the model with a priori covariates, we added, one at a time, covariates that were associated in bivariate models (p {\textless} 0.10) with exposures and outcomes at any time point. Additional covariates were included in the final model if the manganese or lead effect estimates changed {\textgreater} 10{\%}. Although only ≤ 8{\%} of eligible children (12 months, 21 of 296; 24 months, 38 of 475) were excluded because of missing covari-ate data, we conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the appropriateness of conducting a complete case analysis by comparing crude estimates for manganese--lead interaction among all eligible children (including those missing data) with those for participants with complete data. We also examined the influ-ence of extreme observations, identified with the generalized extreme studentized deviate many-outlier procedure (Rosner 1983), by fit-ting models with and without outliers. We conducted statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R (version 2.7.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, www.r-project.org). We considered results statistically significant at p {\textless} 0.05.},

	abstract = {Background: Metal exposure and psychosocial stress in pregnancy have each been associated with adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight, but no study has examined the potential interaction between them. Objectives: We examined the modifying effect of psychosocial stress on the association between metals and birth outcomes among pregnant women in Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) birth cohort study. Methods: In our analysis of 682 women from the PROTECT study, we measured 16 essential and non-essential metals in blood samples at two time points. We administered questionnaires to collect information on depression, perceived stress, social support, and life experience during pregnancy. Using K-means clustering, we categorized pregnant women into one of two groups: ``good'' and ``poor'' psychosocial status. We then evaluated whether the effect of blood metals (geometric average) on adverse birth outcomes (gestational age, preterm birth [overall and spontaneous], birth weight z-score, small for gestation [SGA], large for gestation [LGA]) vary between two clusters of women, adjusting for maternal age, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and second-hand smoke exposure. Results: Blood manganese (Mn) was associated with an increased odds ratio (OR) of overall preterm birth (OR/interquartile range [IQR] = 2.76, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.25, 6.12) and spontaneous preterm birth (OR/IQR: 3.68, 95{\%} CI: 1.20, 6.57) only among women with ``poor'' psychosocial status. The association between copper (Cu) and SGA was also statistically significant only among women having ``poor'' psychosocial status (OR/IQR: 2.81, 95{\%} CI: 1.20, 6.57). We also observed associations between nickel (Ni) and preterm birth and SGA that were modified by psychosocial status during pregnancy. Conclusions: Presence of ``poor'' psychosocial status intensified the adverse associations between Mn and preterm birth, Cu and SGA, and protective effects of Ni on preterm. This provides evidence that prenatal psychosocial stress may modify vulnerability to metal exposure.},

	abstract = {Background: Methylmercury (MeHg) is a known neurotoxicant. Emerging evidence indicates it may have adverse effects on the neurologic and other body systems at common low levels of exposure. Impacts of MeHg exposure could vary by individual susceptibility or be confounded by beneficial nutrients in fish containing MeHg. Despite its global relevance, synthesis of the available literature on low-level MeHg exposure has been limited. Objectives: We undertook a synthesis of the current knowledge on the human health effects of low-level MeHg exposure to provide a basis for future research efforts, risk assessment, and exposure remediation policies worldwide. Data sources and extraction: We reviewed the published literature for original human epidemiologic research articles that reported a direct biomarker of mercury exposure. To focus on high-quality studies and those specifically on low mercury exposure, we excluded case series, as well as studies of populations with unusually high fish consumption (e.g., the Seychelles), marine mammal consumption (e.g., the Faroe Islands, circumpolar, and other indigenous populations), or consumption of highly contaminated fish (e.g., gold-mining regions in the Amazon). ata synthesis: Recent evidence raises the possibility of effects of low-level MeHg exposure on fetal growth among susceptible subgroups and on infant growth in the first 2 years of life. Low-level effects of MeHg on neurologic outcomes may differ by age, sex, and timing of exposure. No clear pattern has been observed for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk across populations or for specific CVD end points. For the few studies evaluating immunologic effects associated with MeHg, results have been inconsistent. Conclusions: Studies targeted at identifying potential mechanisms of low-level MeHg effects and characterizing individual susceptibility, sexual dimorphism, and nonlinearity in dose response would help guide future prevention, policy, and regulatory efforts surrounding MeHg exposure.},

	abstract = {Manganese (Mn) is both an essential element and a potent neurotoxin. Higher demand during pregnancy leads to increased blood levels. Previous studies have suggested that environmental factors may influence blood Mn levels. As part of a community-based survey of potentially toxic environmental contaminants among pregnant women, the objective of this exploratory study was to examine the Mn status in pregnant women and their newborns with respect to sociodemographic and environmental variables. Pregnant women from Southwest Quebec were recruited in the first or second trimester through the public health prenatal program Mn was analyzed in mother's blood at entry into the study, in the second trimester (for those who entered during the first trimester), and at delivery, as well as in umbilical cord blood and in placental tissue. Sociodemographic data and information about pregnancy were obtained by two questionnaires; the first was administered at study entry and the second a few weeks following birth. Results showed that mothers' Mn blood levels increased significantly during pregnancy and cord blood Mn levels were significantly higher than those for mothers' blood. There was no relation to age. Smokers had significantly lower Mn blood levels compared to nonsmokers at the second trimester. Those who lived in urban and/or agricultural areas had significantly higher levels compared to those who lived in small villages. Those who reported pesticide spraying less than 1 km from their house likewise had significantly higher levels compared to the others. These findings suggest that lifestyle and environmental factors may interfere with the delicate balance and homeostatic mechanisms required to maintain Mn at optimal levels for physiological changes during pregnancy.},

Data on study design, population characteristics, collection and analysis of placenta specimens, and main results were extracted using a standardized form.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found a total of 79 papers (73 different studies). Hg, Cd, and Pb levels were reported in 24, 46, and 46 studies, respectively. Most studies included small convenience samples of healthy pregnant women. Studies were heterogeneous regarding populations selected, processing of specimens, and presentation of results. Hg concentrations {\textgreater} 50 ng/g were found in China (Shanghai), Japan, and the Faroe Islands. Cd levels ranged from 1.2 ng/g to 53 ng/g and were highest in the United States, Japan, and Eastern Europe. Pb showed the greatest variability, with levels ranging from 1.18 ng/g in China (Shanghai) to 500 ng/g in a polluted area of Poland.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The use of the placenta as a biomarker to assess heavy metals exposure is not properly developed because of heterogeneity among the studies. International standardized protocols are needed to enhance comparability and increase the usefulness of this promising tissue in biomonitoring studies.},

	abstract = {Arsenic-contaminated rice grain may threaten human health globally. Since H3AsO30 is the predominant As species found in paddy pore-waters, and H4SiO40 and H 3AsO30 share an uptake pathway, silica amendments have been proposed to decrease As uptake and consequent As concentrations in grains. Here, we evaluated the impact of two silicate mineral additions differing in solubility (+SiL, diatomaceous earth, 0.29 mM Si; +SiH, Si-gel, 1.1 mM Si) to soils differing in mineralogy on arsenic concentration in rice. The +SiL addition either did not change or decreased As concentration in pore-water but did not change or increased grain-As levels relative to the (+As-Si) control. The +SiH addition increased As in pore-water, but it significantly decreased grain-As relative to the (+As-Si) control. Only the +SiH addition resulted in significant increases in straw- and husk-Si. Total grain- and straw-As was negatively correlated with pore-water Si, and the relationship differed between two soils exhibiting different mineralogy. These differing results are a consequence of competition between H4SiO40 and H3AsO30 for adsorption sites on soil solids and subsequent plant-uptake, and illustrate the importance of Si mineralogy on arsenic uptake. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Kidney disease is emerging as an arsenic (As)-linked disease outcome, however further evidence of this association is warranted. Our first objective for this paper was to examine the potential renal toxicity of As exposure in Bangladesh. Our second objective relates to examining whether the previously reported positive association between urinary creatinine (uCrn) and As methylation may be explained by renal function. We had hypothesized that these associations relate to supply and demand for s-adenosylmethionine, the methyl donor for both creatine synthesis and As methylation. Alternatively, renal function could influence both As and creatinine excretion, or the As metabolites may influence renal function, which in turn influences uCrn. We conducted a cross-sectional study (N=478) of adults, composed of a sample recruited in 2001 and a sample recruited in 2003. We assessed renal function using plasma cystatin C, and calculated the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Consistent with renal toxicity of As, log-uAs had a marginal inverse association with eGFR in the 2003 sample (b=-5.6, p=0.07), however this association was not significant in the 2001 sample (b=-1.9, p=0.24). Adjustment for eGFR did not alter the associations between uCrn and the {\%}uAs metabolites, indicating that GFR does not explain these associations. Increased eGFR was associated with increased odds of having {\%}uInAs {\textgreater}12.2{\%} (2001: OR=1.01, 95{\%}CI (1.00,1.03); 2003: OR=1.04, 95{\%}CI (1.01,1.07)). In the 2003 sample only, there was a negative association between eGFR and {\%}uDMA (b=-0.08, p=0.02). These results may indicate differential effects of renal function on excretion of InAs and DMA. Alternatively, a certain methylation pattern, involving decreased {\%}InAs and increased {\%}DMA, may reduce renal function. Given that these studies were cross-sectional, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Discrepancies between the samples may be due to the higher As exposure, poorer nutrition, and lower As methylation capacity in the 2003 sample.},

	abstract = {Background: Mercury is a ubiquitous heavy metal that may negatively affect human health. It is desirable to investigate mercury exposure in vulnerable populations. Objective: To determine the concentrations of total mercury (T-Hg) in cord blood and to evaluate the role of maternal fish consumption in a Spanish mother and child cohort. Methods: A total of 1883 mother and child pairs from a population-based cohort were included between 2004 and 2008. T-Hg concentrations were measured in whole cord blood and maternal seafood consumption was ascertained by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. Linear regression was used in stratified analyses, while a joint model was adjusted using a mixed-effects linear model. Results: Maternal daily seafood consumption was 78. g/d and the geometric mean for T-Hg was 8.2 ??g/L. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy, mother's age, country of origin, educational level, employment status and parity, as well as area of study and season of delivery, were associated with cord blood T-Hg levels. A doubling in consumption of large oily fish was associated with an increase of 11.4{\%} (95{\%}CI: 3.8 to 19.6{\%}) in cord blood T-Hg levels, followed by an increase of 8.4{\%} (95{\%}CI: 5.7 to 11.2{\%}) in the case of canned tuna and 8.3{\%} (95{\%}CI: 5.5 to 11.1{\%}) in that of lean fish. Conclusion: A high proportion of newborns had elevated concentrations of cord blood T-Hg according to the current US-EPA reference dose (5.8 ??g/L for methylmercury). Mercury concentrations were related to maternal fish consumption, with large oily fish being the main contributor. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Toenail is metabolic end product of the skin, which can provide information about heavy metal accumulation in human cells. Slow growth rates of toenail can represent heavy metal exposure from 2 to 12 months before the clipping. The toenail is a non-invasive biomarker that is easy to collect and store and is stable over time. In this systematic review, the suitability of toenail as a long-term biomarker was reviewed, along with the analysis and validation of toenail and confounders to heavy metal. This systematic review has included 30 articles chosen from a total of 132 articles searched from online electronic databases like Pubmed, Proquest, Science Direct, and SCOPUS. Keywords used in the search included "toenail", "biomarker", "heavy metal", and "drinking water". Heavy metal in toenail can be accurately analyzed using an ICP-MS instrument. The validation of toenail heavy metal concentration data is very crucial; however, the Certified Reference Material (CRM) for toenail is still unavailable. Usually, CRM for hair is used in toenail studies. Confounders that have major effects on heavy metal accumulation in toenail are dietary intake of food and supplement, smoking habit, and overall health condition. This review has identified the advantages and limitations of using toenail as a biomarker for long-term exposure, which can help future researchers design a study on heavy metal exposure using toenail.},

	abstract = {Neurotoxicity of individual metals is well investigated but that of metal mixture (MM), an environmental reality, in the developing brain is relatively obscure. We investigated the combi-natorial effect of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) on rat brain development, spanning in utero to postnatal development. MM was administered by gavage to pregnant and lactating rats, and to postweaning pups till 2 months. The pups exhibited behavioral disturbances characterized by hyperlocomotion, increased grip strength, and learning-memory deficit. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was associated with dose-dependent increase in deposition of the metals in developing brain. Astrocytes were affected by MM treatment as evident from their reduced density, area, perimeter, compactness, and number of processes, and increased apoptosis in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The metals induced synergistic reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression during brain development ; however, postweaning withdrawal of MM partially restored the levels of GFAP in adults. To characterize the toxic mechanism, we treated rat primary astrocytes with MM at concentrations ranging from lethal concentration (LC) 10 to LC 75 of the metals. We observed synergistic downregulation in viability and increase in apoptosis of the astrocytes, which were induced by proximal activation of extra cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and downstream activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Furthermore, rise in intracellular calcium ion ([Ca 21 ] i) and reactive oxygen species generation promoted apoptosis in the astrocytes. Taken together, these observations are the first to show that mixture of As, Cd, and Pb has the capacity to induce synergistic toxicity in astrocytes that may compromise the BBB and may cause behavioral dysfunction in developing rats.},

	abstract = {Objective: Nearly all China's rural residents and a shrinking fraction of urban residents use solid fuels (biomass and coal) for household cooking and/or heating. Consequently, global meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies indicate that indoor air pollution from solid fuel use in China is responsible for approximately 420,000 premature deaths annually, more than the approximately 300,000 attributed to urban outdoor air pollution in the country. Our objective in this review was to help elucidate the extent of this indoor air pollution health hazard. Data Sources. We reviewed approximately 200 publications in both Chinese- and English-language journals that reported health effects, exposure characteristics, and fuel/stove intervention options. Conclusions: Observed health effects include respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, weakening of the immune system, and reduction in lung function. Arsenic poisoning and fluorosis resulting from the use of "poisonous" coal have been observed in certain regions of China. Although attempts have been made in a few studies to identify specific coal smoke constituents responsible for specific adverse health effects, the majority of indoor air measurements include those of only particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and/or nitrogen dioxide. These measurements indicate that pollution levels in households using solid fuel generally exceed China's indoor air quality standards. Intervention technologies ranging from simply adding a chimney to the more complex modernized bioenergy program are available, but they can be viable only with coordinated support from the government and the commercial sector.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 1958 to 1970, {\textgreater}100,000 people in northern Chile were exposed to  a well-documented, distinct period of high drinking water arsenic concentrations. We previously reported ecological evidence suggesting that early-life exposure in this population resulted in increased mortality in adults from several outcomes, including lung and bladder cancer. METHODS: We have now completed the first study ever assessing incident cancer cases after early-life arsenic exposure, and the first study on this topic with individual participant exposure and confounding factor data. Subjects included 221 lung and 160 bladder cancer cases diagnosed in northern Chile from 2007 to 2010, and 508 age and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: ORs adjusted for age, sex, and smoking in those only exposed in early life to arsenic water concentrations of {\textless}/=110, 110 to 800, and {\textgreater}800 mug/L were 1.00, 1.88 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.96-3.71], and 5.24 (3.05-9.00; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001) for lung cancer, and 1.00, 2.94 (1.29-6.70), and 8.11 (4.31-15.25; P(trend) {\textless} 0.001) for bladder cancer. ORs were lower in those not exposed until adulthood. The highest category ({\textgreater}800 mug/L) involved exposures that started 49 to 52 years before, and ended 37 to 40 years before the cancer cases were diagnosed. CONCLUSION: Lung and bladder cancer incidence in adults was markedly increased following exposure to arsenic in early life, even up to 40 years after high exposures ceased. Such findings have not been identified before for any environmental exposure, and suggest that humans are extraordinarily susceptible to early-life arsenic exposure. IMPACT: Policies aimed at reducing early-life exposure may help reduce the long-term risks of arsenic-related disease.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine if the short semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a reliable and valid tool to assess the diet of Spanish children aged 7-9 years. We collected data from 156 children of the birth cohort INMA (Infancia y Medio Ambiente (Environment and Childhood)). Children's parents or care-givers completed a 46-item FFQ on two occasions over a 9-12-month period about the children's diet. To explore the reproducibility of the FFQ, the nutrient and food group intake collected from the both FFQs were compared, while validity was examined by contrasting the nutrient values from the FFQs and the average of three 24-hour dietary recalls (24hDRs) taken in this period, and also with the concentration of several vitamins in the blood (carotenoids, vitamin D and a-tocopherol). Pearson and de-attenuated correlation coefficients were calculated. The average correlation coefficients for nutrient intake's reproducibility was 0.41, ranging from 0.25 (calcium) to 0.65 (Β-carotene), and for food group intake was 0.45, ranging from 0.18 (cereals) to 0.68 (sweetened beverages). Correlation coefficients slightly improved when we compared energy-adjusted intakes. The average correlation coefficients for validity against 24hDRs was 0.34 for energy-adjusted intakes, and 0.39 when de-attenuation coefficients were used. The validity coefficients against the blood concentrations of vitamins were 0.38 for Β-cryptoxanthin, 0.26 for lycopene, 0,23 for a-carotene and 0.15 for Β-carotene, all of them statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05). This study suggests that our brief FFQ is a suitable tool for the dietary assessment of a wide range of nutrients and food groups in children 7-9 years, despite the low to moderate reproducibility and validity observed for some nutrients.},

	abstract = {The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) measures adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, but the association between the HEI-2005 and risk of chronic disease is not known. The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), which is based on foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease risk, was associated inversely with chronic disease risk previously. We updated the AHEI, including additional dietary factors involved in the development of chronic disease, and assessed the associations between the AHEI-2010 and the HEI-2005 and risk of major chronic disease prospectively among 71,495 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 41,029 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who were free of chronic disease at baseline. During {\$}24 y of follow-up, we documented 26,759 and 15,558 incident chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, or nontrauma death) among women and men, respectively. The RR (95{\%} CI) of chronic disease comparing the highest with the lowest quintile was 0.84 (0.81, 0.87) for the HEI-2005 and 0.81 (0.77, 0.85) for the AHEI-2010. The AHEI-2010 and HEI-2005 were most strongly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes, and for both outcomes the AHEI-2010 was more strongly associated with risk than the HEI-2005 (P-difference = 0.002 and {\textless}0.001, respectively). The 2 indices were similarly associated with risk of stroke and cancer. These findings suggest that closer adherence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines may lower risk of major chronic disease. However, the AHEI-2010, which included additional dietary information, was more strongly associated with chronic disease risk, particularly CHD and diabetes.},

	abstract = {Tobacco smoking, certain occupational exposures, and exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water have been associated with the occurrence of bladder cancer. However, in these tumors the exposure-associated pattern of somatic alterations in genes in the causal pathway for disease has been poorly characterized. Animal and in vitro studies have suggested that arsenic, tobacco carcinogens, and other exposures may act through epigenetic mechanisms. We, therefore, examined, in a population-based study of human bladder cancer (n = 351), the relationship between epigenetic silencing of the tumor-suppressor genes, p16(INK4A), RASSF1A, PRSS3, and the four SFRP genes and exposure to both tobacco and arsenic in bladder cancer. Promotor methylation silencing of each of these genes occurred in approximately 30-50{\%} of bladder cancers. Epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A and PRSS3 and any of the SFRP genes were each significantly associated with advanced tumor stage (P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.04, and P {\textless} 0.005, respectively). Arsenic exposure, measured as toenail arsenic, was associated with RASSF1A (P {\textless} 0.02) and PRSS3 (P {\textless} 0.1) but not p16(INK4A) or SFRP promotor methylation, in models adjusted for stage and other risk factors. Cigarette smoking was associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of promotor methylation of the p16(INK4A) gene, with greater risk seen in patients with exposures more recent to disease diagnosis, and smoking was also significantly associated with any SFRP gene methylation (P {\textless} 0.01). These results from human bladder tumors, add to the body of animal and in vitro evidence that suggests bladder carcinogens play a crucial role in the induction of important epigenetic alterations.},

	abstract = {In April 1998, a holding lagoon containing pyrite ore processing waste, failed and released an estimated 5-6 million m3 of metal rich sludge and acidic waters into the Rio Guadiamar, SW Spain. Over 2700 ha of the internationally important Do{\~{n}}ana National and Natural Parks were contaminated. The sludge component of the waste contained up to 0.6{\%} arsenic. This paper presents an extensive set of 0-5 cm soil analyses results from samples taken 6-8 months after the spill. Data are presented on pseudo-total arsenic levels in these samples, and on arsenic removed by both single batch and sequential extraction techniques. Pseudo-total levels of arsenic in the sludge ranged from 1521 to 3510 mg kg-1, and a mean 4.4{\%} of this was found to be extractable using 2.5{\%} acetic acid. Soils in the Guadiamar Valley and Entremuros areas (those worst affected by the spill) were found to contain 85.4-782 mg kg-1 and 7.1-196 mg kg-1 pseudo-total arsenic, respectively. The mean acetic acid extractable component in these areas was 2.5{\%} and 4.9{\%}, respectively. Background pseudo-total arsenic levels in the soils of the area have been found to be 4.2-13.6 mg kg-1. Rapid input of acidic waters, and the acidic nature of the sludge itself, may have caused depletion of Mg, Na and K, and to a lesser extent Mn, Ca and PO4 in the upper 5 cm of the worst affected soils. Sequential extraction results suggest clear As-Fe associations, and possible As-Mn associations within the more soluble phases. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Children's environmental health researchers are increasingly interested in identifying time intervals during which individuals are most susceptible to adverse impacts of environmental exposures. We review recent advances in methods for assessing susceptible periods. Recent Findings: We identified three general classes of modeling approaches aimed at identifying susceptible periods in children's environmental health research: multiple informant models, distributed lag models, and Bayesian approaches. Benefits over traditional regression modeling include the ability to formally test period effect differences, to incorporate highly time-resolved exposure data, or to address correlation among exposure periods or exposure mixtures. Summary: Several statistical approaches exist for investigating periods of susceptibility. Assessment of susceptible periods would be advanced by additional basic biological research, further development of statistical methods to assess susceptibility to complex exposure mixtures, validation studies evaluating model assumptions, replication studies in different populations, and consideration of susceptible periods from before conception to disease onset.},

However, no prior studies have addressed response to well water testing for arsenic during pregnancy, a time of known heightened risk perception. Using a US pregnancy cohort, we assessed the impact of receiving well water arsenic test results on subsequent use of arsenic-contaminated tap water. Study participants were 24-28 weeks' gestation at study entry and reported living in a residence served by a private, unregulated well. Upon enrollment participants provided a tap water sample which was tested for arsenic using ICP-MS. During pregnancy and every four months after, participants were asked their extent of tap water use for drinking, cooking and mixing infant formula. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of tap water use at one year post-partum in relation to baseline tap water use and arsenic concentration. Compared to those who used tap water {\textless}50{\%} of the time, mothers who reported using tap water for drinking and cooking {\textgreater}50{\%} of time in their prenatal questionnaire had 8.54 times the odds of using their tap water at 1-year postpartum (95{\%} CI: 5.37, 13.60). After adjusting for frequency of prenatal tap water use, mothers were less likely to use tap water for drinking and cooking (OR = 0.34, 95{\%} CI: 0.19, 0.60) and for mixing formula (OR = 0.45, 95{\%} CI: 0.24, 0.86) if the high arsenic concentration ({\textgreater}10 $\mu$g/L) was known to them. Our findings suggest that providing well water test results during pregnancy may reduce subsequent maternal use of iAs contaminated tap water for drinking, cooking, and mixing infant formula.

	abstract = {Ingestion of drinking water is not the only elevated source of arsenic to the diet in the Bengal Delta. Even at background levels, the arsenic in rice contributes considerably to arsenic ingestion in subsistence rice diets. We set out to survey As speciation in different rice varieties from different parts of the globe to understand the contribution of rice to arsenic exposure. Pot experiments were utilized to ascertain whether growing rice on As contaminated soil affected speciation and whether genetic variation accounted for uptake and speciation. USA long grain rice had the highest mean arsenic level in the grain at 0.26 microg As g(-1) (n = 7), and the highest grain arsenic value of the survey at 0.40 microg As g(-1). The mean arsenic level of Bangladeshi rice was 0.13 microg As g(-1) (n = 15). The main As species detected in the rice extract were AsIII, DMAV, and AsV. In European, Bangladeshi, and Indian rice 64 +/- 1{\%} (n = 7), 80 +/- 3{\%} (n = 11), and 81 +/- 4{\%} (n = 15), respectively, of the recovered arsenic was found to be inorganic. In contrast, DMAV was the predominant species in rice from the USA, with only 42 +/- 5{\%} (n = 12) of the arsenic being inorganic. Pot experiments show that the proportions of DMAV in the grain are significantly dependent on rice cultivar (p = 0.026) and that plant nutrient status is effected by arsenic exposure.},

@article{Kogel-Knabner2010,
	abstract = {Paddy soils make up the largest anthropogenic wetlands on earth. They may originate from any type of soil in pedological terms, but are highly modified by anthropogenic activities. The formation of these Anthrosols is induced by tilling the wet soil (puddling), and the flooding and drainage regime associated with the development of a plough pan and specific redoximorphic features. Redox potential oscillations due to paddy management control microbial community structure and function and thus short-term biogeochemical processes. After flooding, microbial reduction processes sequentially use NO3
-, Mn4+, Fe3+, SO4
2- as electron acceptors, accompanied by the emission of the trace gases N2O, N2, H2S, CH4 and - due to reduction-induced increasing pH - NH3. This results in N losses and low N fertilizer use efficiency. However, transport of atmospheric O2 to the roots via the rice plant's aerenchyma modifies conditions in the rhizosphere, leading to nitrification and methane oxidation, and precipitation of Mn and Fe oxides. High concentrations and fluxes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in paddy soils from plant debris trigger microbial activity and thus the emission of greenhouse gases. Retention of DOM by soil minerals and its subsequent stabilisation against microbial decay depend on the redox state (e.g. DOM precipitation by Fe2+ under anaerobic conditions). Oscillation in redox conditions may enhance retention and stabilisation of DOM by Fe oxyhydroxides. Induced by the periodic short-term redox cycles, paddy management over long periods has strong effects on long-term biogeochemical processes. Frequent irrigation intensifies mineral weathering and leaching processes. High concentrations of DOM during flooding seasons enhance the changes and the release of structural iron in clay minerals, and support the formation of ferrihydrite. Repeated redox alternations lead to a translocation of iron in various directions, and particularly increase the crystallinity of iron oxides. This results also in higher total iron oxide contents in paddy compared to non-paddy soils. The large accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) observed in some, but not all paddy soils, is considered to be due to high input of plant residues and charred material associated with retarded decomposition under anaerobic conditions. There is also evidence of SOM stabilisation via occlusion into aggregates and phytoliths as well as interactions with clay minerals and iron oxides. SOM accumulation in paddy subsoils can be explained by downward movement of DOM and its stabilisation by interaction with iron oxides. A specific feature of paddy soils is the coupling of organic matter turnover with mineral transformations and fluxes, which seem to be intensified by the alternating redox conditions with increasing age of paddy soil development. Bioavailability of soil organic N is strongly coupled to SOM cycling and is a crucial parameter determining crop yield. Anaerobic conditions inhibit N mineralization, with a high risk of gaseous N losses. In paddy soils the management-induced, microbially mediated redox processes control the dynamics of soil minerals and soil organic matter, which are strongly related to the microbial accessibility of C and N, but also of Fe. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Arsenic and arsenic containing compounds are human carcinogens. Exposure to arsenic  occurs occupationally in several industries, including mining, pesticide, pharmaceutical, glass and microelectronics, as well as environmentally from both industrial and natural sources. Inhalation is the principal route of arsenic exposure in occupational settings, while ingestion of contaminated drinking water is the predominant source of significant environmental exposure globally. Drinking water contamination by arsenic remains a major public health problem. Acute and chronic arsenic exposure via drinking water has been reported in many countries of the world, where a large proportion of drinking water is contaminated with high concentrations of arsenic. General health effects that are associated with arsenic exposure include cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, developmental anomalies, neurologic and neurobehavioural disorders, diabetes, hearing loss, portal fibrosis, hematologic disorders (anemia, leukopenia and eosinophilia) and multiple cancers: significantly higher standardized mortality rates and cumulative mortality rates for cancers of the skin, lung, liver, urinary bladder, kidney, and colon in many areas of arsenic pollution. Although several epidemiological studies have documented the sources of exposure and the global impact of arsenic contamination, the mechanisms by which arsenic induces health effects, including cancer, are not well characterized. Further research is needed to provide a better understanding of the pathobiology of arsenic-induced diseases and to better define the toxicologic pathology of arsenic in various organ systems. In this review, we provide and discuss the underlying pathology and nature of arsenic-induced lesions. Such information is critical for understanding the magnitude of health effects associated with arsenic exposure throughout the world.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with cancer and
hypertension. Growing evidence suggests that altered methylation in long
interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) is involved in many types of
disorders, including cardiovascular disease. Here we evaluated the
association between arsenic exposure and LINE-1 methylation levels,
especially in relation to blood pressure (BP).
Methods: A total of 236 subjects (175 from arsenic-endemic areas and 61
from a non-endemic area) in rural Bangladesh were recruited. The
subjects' arsenic exposure levels (i.e., drinking water, hair and nail
arsenic concentrations) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass
spectroscopy. The subjects' LINE-1 methylation levels were determined by
pyrosequencing.
Results: The average LINE-1 methylation levels of the subjects living in
the arsenic-endemic areas were significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) lower than those
of the subjects living in the non-endemic area. In a sex-stratified
analysis, the arsenic exposure levels in female but not male subjects
showed a significant inverse association with LINE-1 methylation levels
before (water arsenic: p {\textless} 0.01, hair arsenic: p {\textless} 0.05, nail arsenic: p
{\textless} 0.001) and after (water arsenic: p {\textless} 0.01, hair arsenic: p {\textless} 0.05,
nail arsenic: p {\textless} 0.001) adjustment for age, body mass index and
smoking. Analyses examining interactions among arsenic levels, BP and
LINE-1 methylation showed that arsenic-related elevated levels of BP
were associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that chronic exposure to arsenic
was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation levels in blood
leukocyte DNA and this was more pronounced in females than males; in
addition, the decreased levels of LINE-1 methylation might be involved
in the arsenic-induced elevation of BP.},

In the past few years, several studies have demonstrated that contents of total As (tAs) and iAs depend on rice type. Brown/wholegrain rice has higher iAs than white/polished rice because iAs follows the order husk/hull. {\textgreater}{\textgreater}. bran. {\textgreater}. endosperm. Current "all-natural" tendencies are making brown rice very popular among adults; however, the safety of fashion products should be carefully checked and proved before their use in the infant diet. Workable solutions to limit As in paddy rice by screening/breeding rice cultivars with low As accumulation are being sought but are not yet fully implemented. Meanwhile, simple recommendations for rice processing in the manufacturing of infant foods will significantly help in reducing As exposure in infants worldwide. The main conclusion is that only white/polished rice with proven low iAs content should be used in the manufacture of infant/baby foods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to inorganic arsenic through drinking water is a threat for public health. Using the arsenic-containing water in the long-term causes a variety of skin diseases, high blood pressure, and skin cancer. Arsenic also damages the nervous system. A wide range of studies have studied the effect of arsenic in drinking water on the level of intelligence in children. Methods: For the purpose of our research, we searched three electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline (PubMed) in English from 2000 to January 2018. We used the dose-response meta-analysis through applying random effect models in order to estimate the pooled association (with a 95{\%} uncertainty) between water arsenic concentration and intelligence level. Results: Using a two-stage random effect model to investigate the dose-response association between arsenic concentration and Intelligence Quotient scale, we estimated a significant linear association as −0.08 (95{\%} CI: −0.14, −0.01). Actually, for each unit increase in arsenic concentration (one microgram per liter), intelligence quotient scale decreases by 0.08{\%}. Conclusions: Considering the significance of the relationship between arsenic concentration in drinking water and the level of intelligence quotient as an important factor in training, the level of arsenic and its associated risks should be decreased in water resources.},

@article{Tolins2014,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 200 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to arsenic. Arsenic is a known human carcinogen, and its carcinogenic and systemic toxicity have been extensively studied. By contrast, the developmental neurotoxicity of arsenic has been less well described. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive review of the developmental neurotoxicity of arsenic. METHODS: We reviewed the published epidemiological and toxicological literature on the developmental neurotoxicity of arsenic. RESULTS: Arsenic is able to gain access to the developing brain and cause neurotoxic effects. Animal models link prenatal and early postnatal exposure to reduction in brain weight, reductions in numbers of glia and neurons, and alterations in neurotransmitter systems. Animal and in vitro studies both suggest that oxidative stress may be a mechanism of arsenic neurotoxicity. Fifteen epidemiological studies indicate that early life exposure is associated with deficits in intelligence and memory. These effects may occur at levels of exposure below current safety guidelines, and some neurocognitive consequences may become manifest only later in life. Sex, concomitant exposures, and timing of exposure appear to modify the developmental neurotoxicity of arsenic. Four epidemiological studies failed to show behavioral outcomes of arsenic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The published literature indicates that arsenic is a human developmental neurotoxicant. Ongoing and future prospective birth cohort studies will allow more precise definition of the developmental consequences of arsenic exposure in early life.},

We have developed an irradiation position for the neutron activation analysis (NAA) of nail specimens for arsenic, in support of a case-control study involving New Hampshire residents consuming well water above the EPA Safe Drinking Water Standard of 0.050 ppm. Arsenic is bound to nail keratin through sulfhydryl groups proportional to intake providing a convenient means of integrating arsenic intake in population-based studies. Our objective was to develop the necessary facilities and procedures by which relatively small samples (i.e. 20 to 100 mg) could be accurately analyzed for arsenic, so that affordable nutritional epidemiology investigations, requiting large numbers of samples ({\textgreater}1000 in this case), could be undertaken. A high-flux reflector position, with minimal axial variation throughout the fuel cycle, suitable for pneumatic-tube irradiations, was characterized by measurement of the neutron flux distribution (thermal and epithermal) within the irradiation capsule over time. Results from application of the method to a case-control study of basal and squamous cell skin cancer will be presented.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous studies have suggested an effect of high arsenic concentration on cognitive and neurobehavioral function in humans. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to identify demographic and nutritional factors that are associated with As exposure and the influence of this exposure on cognitive function in school-age children. METHODS We recruited 602 children 6-8 years of age living within 3.5 km of a metallurgic smelter complex in the city of Torre{\'{o}}n, Mexico, to participate in a cross-sectional evaluation. Of these, 591 had complete anthropometry, iron, and zinc status by biochemical measurements in serum, blood lead concentration (PbB), and arsenic in urine (UAs), and 557 completed several cognitive performance tests. RESULTS The mean for UAs was 58.1 +/- 33.2 microg/L; 52{\%} of the children had UAs concentrations {\textgreater} 50 microg/L, and 50.7{\%} of children had PbB {\textgreater} or = 10 microg/dL. UAs concentration was associated with low socioeconomic status. Nutritional status indicators were not related to UAs concentrations. Linear and logistic regressions adjusted for hemoglobin concentration, PbB, and sociodemographic confounders showed a significant inverse association between UAs and Visual-Spatial Abilities with Figure Design, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the WISC-RM Digit Span subscale, Visual Search, and Letter Sequencing Tests (p {\textless} 0.05). Boys excreted significantly more UAs (p {\textless} 0.05) and were affected on different cognitive areas than girls. CONCLUSIONS Children living in an area contaminated with both As and lead showed that As contamination can affect children's cognitive development, independent of any effect of lead.},

	abstract = {Lung-related research primarily focuses on the etiology and management of diseases. In recent years, interest in primary prevention has grown. However, primary prevention also includes "health promotion" (actions in a population that keep an individual healthy). We encourage more research on population-based (public health) strategies that could not only maximize lung health but also mitigate "normal" age-related declines - not only for spirometry but across multiple measures of lung health. In developing a successful strategy, a "life course" approach is important. Unfortunately, we are unable to achieve the full benefit of this approach until we have better measures of lung health and an improved understanding of the normal trajectory, both over an individual's life span and possibly across generations. We discuss key questions in lung health promotion, with an emphasis on the upper (healthier) end of the distribution of lung functioning and resiliency and briefly summarize the few interventions that have been studied to date. We conclude with suggestions regarding the most promising future research for this important, but largely neglected, area of lung research.

	abstract = {The present study aimed to assess arsenic exposure and its effect on oxidative DNA damage and repair in young children exposed in utero and continued to live in arsenic-contaminated areas. To address the need for biological specimens that can be acquired with minimal discomfort to children, we used non-invasive urinary and salivary-based assays for assessing arsenic exposure and early biological effects that have potentially serious health implications. Levels of arsenic in nails showed the greatest magnitude of difference between exposed and control groups, followed by arsenic concentrations in saliva and urine. Arsenic levels in saliva showed significant positive correlations with other biomarkers of arsenic exposure, including arsenic accumulation in nails (r= 0.56, P{\textless}. 0.001) and arsenic concentration in urine (r= 0.50, P{\textless}. 0.05). Exposed children had a significant reduction in arsenic methylation capacity indicated by decreased primary methylation index and secondary methylation index in both urine and saliva samples. Levels of salivary 8-OHdG in exposed children were significantly higher ({\~{}}. 4-fold, P{\textless}. 0.01), whereas levels of urinary 8-OHdG excretion and salivary hOGG1 expression were significantly lower in exposed children ({\~{}}. 3-fold, P{\textless}. 0.05), suggesting a defect in hOGG1 that resulted in ineffective cleavage of 8-OHdG. Multiple regression analysis results showed that levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in saliva and urine had a significant positive association with salivary 8-OHdG and a significant negative association with salivary hOGG1 expression.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science searched up to December 2017. Review methods Studies reporting risk estimates for total cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke for levels of arsenic, lead, cadmium, mercury, or copper were included. Two investigators independently extracted information on study characteristics and outcomes in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Relative risks were standardised to a common scale and pooled across studies for each marker using random effects meta-analyses. Results The review identified 37 unique studies comprising 348 259 non-overlapping participants, with 13 033 coronary heart disease, 4205 stroke, and 15 274 cardiovascular disease outcomes in aggregate. Comparing top versus bottom thirds of baseline levels, pooled relative risks for arsenic and lead were 1.30 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.04 to 1.63) and 1.43 (1.16 to 1.76) for cardiovascular disease, 1.23 (1.04 to 1.45) and 1.85 (1.27 to 2.69) for coronary heart disease, and 1.15 (0.92 to 1.43) and 1.63 (1.14 to 2.34) for stroke. Relative risks for cadmium and copper were 1.33 (1.09 to 1.64) and 1.81 (1.05 to 3.11) for cardiovascular disease, 1.29 (0.98 to 1.71) and 2.22 (1.31 to 3.74) for coronary heart disease, and 1.72 (1.29 to 2.28) and 1.29 (0.77 to 2.17) for stroke. Mercury had no distinctive association with cardiovascular outcomes. There was a linear dose-response relation for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with cardiovascular disease outcomes. Conclusion Exposure to arsenic, lead, cadmium, and copper is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Mercury is not associated with cardiovascular risk. These findings reinforce the importance of environmental toxic metals in cardiovascular risk, beyond the roles of conventional behavioural risk factors.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Maternal diet during pregnancy has the potentialto affect airway development and to promote T-helper-2-cell responses during fetal life. This might increase the riskofdeveloping childhood asthma or allergy. Objectives:We investigated the influence of maternal food consumption during pregnancy on childhood asthma outcomes from 1 to 8 years of age. Methods: A birth cohort study consisting of a baseline of 4,146 pregnant women(1,327 atopic and 2,819nonatopic).These women were asked about their frequency of consumption of fruit, vegeta-bles, fish, egg, milk, milk products, nuts, and nut products during the last month. Their children were followed until 8 years of age. Longitudinal analyses were conducted to assess associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and childhood asthma outcomes over 8 years. Measurements and Main Results: Complete data were obtained for 2,832 children. There were no associations between maternal vegetable, fish, egg, milk or milk products, and nut consumption and longitudinal childhood outcomes. Daily consumptionofnut products increased the risk of childhood wheeze (odds ratio [OR] daily versus rare consumption, 1.42; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.06-1.89), dyspnea (OR, 1.58; 95{\%} CI, 1.16-2.15), steroid use (OR, 1.62; 95{\%} CI, 1.06-2.46), and asthma symptoms (OR, 1.47; 95{\%} CI, 1.08-1.99). Conclusions: Results of this study indicate an increased risk of daily versus rare consumption of nut products during pregnancy on child-hood asthma outcomes.These findings need to be replicated by other studies before dietary advice can be given to pregnant women.},

	abstract = {The association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and toenail arsenic concentrations appears to be non-linear at low exposure levels. To investigate whether this observation is a result exposure misclassification, a dietary exposure assessment was conducted in a cohort of 47 women concurrently enrolled in a prospective longitudinal biomonitoring study in Pabna, Bangladesh. Arsenic intake was evaluated using a duplicate diet study design which collected food and water samples for a total of 6 days. Total inorganic arsenic was measured in 24-hour composite food samples (N=282) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry coupled with a dynamic reaction cell (ICP-DRC-MS). Average annual tubewell arsenic concentrations and toenail arsenic concentrations were computed for each participant using biomonitoring data from the prospective study. Separate multivariate regression models evaluated the association between drinking water, total dietary intake, and total dietary dose with toenail arsenic, a biomarker of internal dose. In these models, dietary intakes were adjusted using the residual method to provide estimate that was independent of water arsenic concentrations. Median daily arsenic intake from food and drinking water was 48.3 microg/day and 4.2 microg/day. Taking into consideration participant's body weight, the median daily arsenic dose was 1.0 microg/kg-day from food and 0.1 microg/kg-day from drinking water although drinking water exposure was highly skewed and was the dominant exposure route for the upper 25th percentile of the distribution. The regression model that used total daily arsenic intake from food (beta=0.46; 95{\%}CI: 0.18-0.73) and drinking water (95{\%}CI: 0.26-0.38) explained the most variability in toenail arsenic concentrations (R(2)(a)=0.71). The effect estimates for food and drinking water are similar suggesting that both sources have a similar contribution to internal dose.},

	abstract = {Mining activities may affect the health of miners and communities living near mining sites, and these health effects may persist even when the mine is abandoned. During mining processes various toxic wastes are produced and released into the surrounding environment, resulting in contamination of air, drinking water, rivers, plants, and soils. In a geochemical sampling campaign undertaken in the Panasqueira Mine area of central Portugal, an anomalous dis-tribution of several metals and arsenic (As) was identified in various environmental media. Several potentially harmful elements, including As, cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and selenium (Se), were quantified in blood, urine, hair, and nails (toe and finger) from a group of individuals living near the Panasqueira Mine who were envi-ronmentally and occupationally exposed. A group with similar demographic characteristics without known exposure to mining activities was also compared. Genotoxicity was evaluated by means of T-cell receptor (TCR) mutation assay, and percentages of different lymphocyte subsets were selected as immunotoxicity biomarkers. Inductively coupled plasma--mass spec-trometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma--atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis showed elevated levels of As, Cd, Cr, Mn, and Pb in all biological samples taken from populations living close to the mine compared to controls. Genotoxic and immunotoxic differences were also observed. The results provide evidence of an elevated potential risk to the health of populations, with environmental and occupational exposures resulting from mining activities. Further, the results emphasize the need to implement preventive measures, remediation, and rehabilitation plans for the region.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The susceptibility to arsenic (As)-induced diseases differs greatly between individuals, probably to a large extent due to genetic differences in arsenic metabolism. The aim for this study was to identify genetic variants affecting arsenic metabolism. Methods: We evaluated the association between urinary metabolite pattern and polymorphisms in three gene-groups related to arsenic metabolism: (1) methyltransferases, (2) other genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and (3) genes involved in reduction reactions. Forty-nine polymorphisms were successfully genotyped in indigenous women (N = 104) from northern Argentina, exposed to approximately 200 $\mu$g/L of arsenic in drinking water, with a unique metabolism with low percent monomethylated arsenic ({\%}MMA) and high percent dimethylated As ({\%}DMA). Results: Genetic factors affecting arsenic metabolite pattern included two polymorphisms in arsenic (+III) methyltransferase (AS3MT) (rs3740400, rs7085104), where carriers had lower {\%}MMA and higher {\%}DMA. These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with three intronic AS3MT SNPs, previously reported to be associated with arsenic metabolism, indicating the existence of a strongly methylating, population-specific haplotype. The CYP17A1 rs743572, 27 kilobasepairs (kbs) upstream of AS3MT, was in strong LD with the AS3MT SNPs and thus had similar effects on the metabolite profile. Smaller effects were also seen for one-carbon metabolism genes choline dehydrogenase (CHDH) (rs9001, rs7626693) and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR) (rs1801394) and genes involved in reduction reactions, glutaredoxin (GLRX) (rs3822751) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) (rs10427027, rs12151144). Genotypes associated with more beneficial arsenic metabolite profile (low {\%}MMA and/or high {\%}DMA in urine) were more common in this population, which has been exposed to arsenic in drinking water for thousands of years. Conclusions: Polymorphisms in AS3MT and in genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and reduction reactions affects arsenic metabolism. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs), a class I carcinogen, affects several hundred million people worldwide. Once absorbed, iAs is converted to monomethylated (MMA) and then dimethylated forms (DMA), with methylation facilitating urinary excretion. The abundance of each species in urine relative to their sum (iAs{\%}, MMA{\%}, and DMA{\%}) varies across individuals, reflecting differences in arsenic metabolism capacity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The association of arsenic metabolism phenotypes with participant characteristics and arsenical skin lesions was characterized among 4,794 participants in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (Araihazar, Bangladesh). Metabolism phenotypes include those obtained from principal component (PC) analysis of arsenic species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Two independent PCs were identified: PC1 appears to represent capacity to produce DMA (second methylation step), and PC2 appears to represent capacity to convert iAs to MMA (first methylation step). PC1 was positively associated (P {\textless}0.05) with age, female sex, and BMI, while negatively associated with smoking, arsenic exposure, education, and land ownership. PC2 was positively associated with age and education but negatively associated with female sex and BMI. PC2 was positively associated with skin lesion status, while PC1 was not. 10q24.32/AS3MT region polymorphisms were strongly associated with PC1, but not PC2. Patterns of association for most variables were similar for PC1 and DMA{\%}, and for PC2 and MMA{\%} with the exception of arsenic exposure and SNP associations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Two distinct arsenic metabolism phenotypes show unique associations with age, sex, BMI, 10q24.32 polymorphisms, and skin lesions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPACT: This work enhances our understanding of arsenic metabolism kinetics and toxicity risk profiles.

Here, we show in a greenhouse study that future conditions cause a greater proportion of pore-water arsenite, the more toxic form of arsenic, in the rhizosphere of Californian Oryza sativa L. variety M206, grown on Californian paddy soil. As a result, grain yields decrease by 39{\%} compared to yields at today's arsenic soil concentrations. In addition, future climatic conditions cause a nearly twofold increase of grain inorganic arsenic concentrations. Our findings indicate that climate-induced changes in soil arsenic behaviour and plant response will lead to currently unforeseen losses in rice grain productivity and quality. Pursuing rice varieties and crop management practices that alleviate the coupled stresses of soil arsenic and change in climatic factors are needed to overcome the currently impending food crisis.},

@article{Lynch2014,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) can exist in the environment in several different forms, each having unique chemical characteristics that influence its toxicity and potential for human and ecological exposure. Within the last decade or so, the focus on speciated As (both the inorganic and organic forms) and its potential toxicity has led to an increased availability of data on speciated As in different food types. To gain an understanding of these developments and the current science, we evaluated the state of knowledge regarding As speciation in food and calculated the average levels of several species of As measured in food. Because inorganic arsenic (inAs) is considered the most toxicologically important form of As, we focused our analysis on papers presenting information on total inAs and speciated inAs (inAs3+ or inAs5+). We also evaluated speciated As forms (e.g., monomethylarsonic and dimethylarsinic acid) when presented with inAs information. Publications were drawn from the peer-reviewed literature and reports by authoritative health agencies. While a great deal of speciation data were identified, including over 6500 unique inAs data points, unclear study methodology and inconsistencies between studies introduced uncertainty into the analysis of these data. Despite these limitations, our analysis demonstrates that inAs in foods can vary widely by type and even by sample, with mean inAs concentrations ranging from undetectable (in milk) to 11,000??g/kg (in seaweed/algae). We found a high percentage of non-measurable As in many food types, suggesting that the limits of detection of speciated As must be considered to accurately estimate dietary As exposure. The applicability of our analysis is limited by the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the available data; calculations of inAs dietary intake should be tailored to the study population of interest and should consider study quality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rice can be a major source of inorganic arsenic (Asi) for many sub-populations. Rice products are also used as ingredients in prepared foods, some of which may not be obviously rice based. Organic brown rice syrup (OBRS) is used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. We hypothesized that OBRS introduces As into these products.

OBJECTIVE: We determined the concentration and speciation of As in commercially available brown rice syrups and in products containing OBRS, including toddler formula, cereal/energy bars, and high-energy foods used by endurance athletes.

METHODS: We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and ion chromatography coupled to ICP-MS to determine total As (Astotal) concentrations and As speciation in products purchased via the Internet or in stores in the Hanover, New Hampshire, area.

DISCUSSION: We found that OBRS can contain high concentrations of Asi and dimethyl-arsenate (DMA). An "organic" toddler milk formula containing OBRS as the primary ingredient had Astotal concentrations up to six times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency safe drinking water limit. Cereal bars and high-energy foods containing OBRS also had higher As concentrations than equivalent products that did not contain OBRS. Asi was the main As species in most food products tested in this study.

CONCLUSIONS: There are currently no U.S. regulations applicable to As in food, but our findings suggest that the OBRS products we evaluated may introduce significant concentrations of Asi into an individual's diet. Thus, we conclude that there is an urgent need for regulatory limits on As in food.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors Rice accumulates 10-fold higher inorganic arsenic (i-As), an established human carcinogen, than other grains. This review summarizes epidemiologic studies that examined the association between rice consumption and biomarkers of arsenic exposure. After reviewing the literature we identified 20 studies, among them included 18 observational and 2 human experimental studies that reported on associations between rice consumption and an arsenic biomarker. Among individuals not exposed to contaminated water, rice is a source of i-As exposure -- rice consumption has been consistently related to arsenic biomarkers, and the relationship has been clearly demonstrated in experimental studies. Early-life i-As exposure is of particular concern due to its association with lifelong adverse health outcomes. Maternal rice consumption during pregnancy also has been associated with infant toenail total arsenic concentrations indicating that dietary exposure during pregnancy results in fetal exposure. Thus, the collective evidence indicates that rice is an independent source of arsenic exposure in populations around the world and highlights the importance of investigating its affect on health.},

	abstract = {Although it has been known for decades that humans and many other species convert inorganic arsenic to mono- and dimethylated metabolites, relatively little attention has been given to the biological effects of these methylated products. It has been widely held that inorganic arsenicals were the species that accounted for the toxic and carcinogenic effects of this metalloid and that methylation was properly regarded as a mechanism for detoxification of arsenic. Elucidation of the metabolic pathway for arsenic has changed our understanding of the significance of methylation. Both methylated and dimethylated arsenicals that contain arsenic in the trivalent oxidation state have been identified as intermediates in the metabolic pathway. These compounds have been detected in human cells cultured in the presence of inorganic arsenic and in urine of individuals who were chronically exposed to inorganic arsenic. Methylated and dimethylated arsenicals that contain arsenic in the trivalent oxidation state are more cytotoxic, more genotoxic, and more potent inhibitors of the activities of some enzymes than are inorganic arsenicals that contain arsenic in the trivalent oxidation state. Hence, it is reasonable to describe the methylation of arsenic as a pathway for its activation, not as a mode of detoxification. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the processes that control the formation and fate of the methylated metabolites of arsenic and of the biological effects of these compounds. Given the considerable interest in the dose-response relationships for arsenic as a toxin and a carcinogen, understanding the metabolism of arsenic may be critical to assessing the risk associated with chronic exposure to this element.},

Confirming the single dose study AB and DMA excreted were apparently endogenously formed from other arsenicals ingested. Total tAs excretion was 1386, 763 and 303. ??g in the cod, blue mussel and salmon groups, respectively; about twice the amounts after the single dose study indicating accumulation of arsenicals. In the cod group, rapid excretion after the single dose was associated with lower total As in blood and less accumulation after two weeks with seafood indicating lower accumulation. In the blue mussels group only, inorganic As (iAs) excretion increased significantly, whilst methylarsonate (MA) strongly increased, indicating a possible toxicological concern of repeated mussel consumption. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Urine, tap-water and toenail samples were collected from non-smoking adults residing in Ajo (n=40) and Tucson (n=33), Arizona, USA. The Ajo subjects were provided bottled water for 12 months prior to re-sampling. The mean total arsenic (microg/L) in tap-water was 20.3+/-3.7 in Ajo and 4.0+/-2.3 in Tucson. Baseline urinary total inorganic arsenic (microg/L) was significantly higher among the Ajo subjects (n=40, 29.1+/-20.4) than among the Tucson subjects (n=32, 11.0+/-12.0, p{\textless}0.001), as was creatinine-adjusted urinary total inorganic arsenic (microg/g) (35.5+/-25.2 vs 13.2+/-9.3, p{\textless}0.001). Baseline concentrations of arsenic (microg/g) in toenails were also higher among the Ajo subjects (0.51+/-0.72) than among the Tucson subjects (0.17+/-0.21) (p{\textless}0.001).

However, little is known about rice products as additional source of i-As exposure. In this study, misos, syrups and amazake (a fermented sweet rice drink) produced from rice, barley and millet were analysed for total arsenic (t-As) and a subset of samples were also analyzed for As speciation. Rice based products displayed a higher i-As content than those derived from barley and millet. Most of the t-As in the rice products studied was inorganic (63-83{\%}), the remainder being dimethylarsinic acid. Those who regularly consume rice drinks and condiments, such as the Japanese population and those who follow health conscious diets based on the Japanese cuisine, could reach up to 23{\%} of the World Health Organization's Provisional Tolerable Daily Intake of i-As, by only consuming these kinds of products. This study provides a wide appreciation of how i-As derived from rice based products enters the human diet and how this may be of concern to populations who are already exposed to high levels of i-As through consumption of foods such as rice and seaweed.},

In the past few years, several studies have demonstrated that contents of total As (tAs) and iAs depend on rice type. Brown/wholegrain rice has higher iAs than white/polished rice because iAs follows the order husk/hull{\textgreater}{\textgreater}bran{\textgreater}endosperm. Current ``all-natural'' tendencies are making brown rice very popular among adults; however, the safety of fashion products should be carefully checked and proved before their use in the infant diet. Workable solutions to limit As in paddy rice by screening/breeding rice cultivars with low As accumulation are being sought but are not yet fully implemented. Meanwhile, simple recommendations for rice processing in the manufacturing of infant foods will significantly help in reducing As exposure in infants worldwide. The main conclusion is that only white/polished rice with proven low iAs content should be used in the manufacture of infant/baby foods.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the excretion of arsenic in breast milk of lactating native Andean women living in a village in northwestern Argentina with high concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water (about 200 $\mu$g/l) and to assess the exposure of children to arsenic during the very first period of life. Methods: The study included ten lactating women and two nursing babies. Hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-AAS) was used to determine the concentration of arsenic in samples of human milk, drinking water, blood, and urine. Results: The concentrations of arsenic detected in maternal blood (total arsenic) and urine (metabolites of inorganic arsenic) were high, averaging 10 and 320 $\mu$g/l, respectively. In subjects without known exposure to arsenic the average concentrations found in blood and urine are 1-2 and about 10 $\mu$g/l, respectively. The metabolites of inorganic arsenic constituted more than 80{\%} of the total arsenic in the urine, which shows that inorganic arsenic was the main form of arsenic ingested. The average concentration of arsenic detected in human milk was 2.3 $\mu$g/kg fresh weight (range 0.83-7.6 $\mu$g/kg). Although data on background levels of arsenic in human breast milk are scarce, the present concentrations seem to be slightly elevated. However, considering the high levels of arsenic exposure in the mothers, the total arsenic concentrations measured in human milk were low. In concordance with the low concentrations of arsenic found in the milk, the concentrations of arsenic metabolites measured in the urine of two of the nursing babies were low, 17 and 47 $\mu$g/l, respectively. Conclusions: The low concentrations of arsenic detected in the breast milk and urine of the two nursing babies in relation to the high level of maternal exposure to arsenic indicate that inorganic arsenic is not excreted in breast milk to any significant extent. This is a very important reason for long breast-feeding periods.},

@article{Molin2012,
	abstract = {Seafood is the predominant food source of several organoarsenic compounds. Some seafood species, like crustaceans and seaweed, also contain inorganic arsenic (iAs), a well-known toxicant. It is unclear whether human biotransformation of ingested organoarsenicals from seafood result in formation of arsenicals of health concern. The present controlled dietary study examined the urinary excretion of arsenic compounds (total arsenic (tAs), iAs, AB (arsenobetaine), dimethylarsinate (DMA) and methylarsonate (MA)) following ingestion of a single test meal of seafood (cod, 780 $\mu$g tAs, farmed salmon, 290 $\mu$g tAs or blue mussel, 690 $\mu$g tAs or potato (control, 110 $\mu$g tAs)) in 38 volunteers. The amount of ingested tAs excreted via the urine within 0-72. h varied significantly among the groups: Cod, 74{\%} (52-92{\%}), salmon 56{\%} (46-82{\%}), blue mussel 49{\%} (37-78{\%}), control 45{\%} (30-60{\%}). The estimated total urinary excretion of AB was higher than the amount of ingested AB in the blue mussel group (112{\%}) and also ingestion of cod seemed to result in more AB, indicating possible endogenous formation of AB from other organoarsenicals. Excretion of iAs was lower than ingested (13-22{\%} of the ingested iAs was excreted in the different groups). Although the ingested amount of iAs+DMA+MA was low for all seafood groups (1.2-4.5{\%} of tAs ingested), the urinary DMA excretion was high in the blue mussel and salmon groups, counting for 25{\%} and 11{\%} of the excreted tAs respectively. In conclusion our data indicate a possible formation of AB as a result of biotransformation of other organic arsenicals. The considerable amount of DMA excreted is probably not only due to methylation of ingested iAs, but due to biotransformation of organoarsenicals making it an inappropriate biomarker of iAs exposure in populations with a high seafood intake. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

One hundred and seventy three women from the Nurses' Health Study completed the questionnaire twice approximately 12 months apart and also recorded their food consumption for seven consecutive days, four times during the one-year interval. For the 55 foods, the mean of correlation coefficients between frequencies of intake for first versus second questionnaire was 0.57 (range = 0.24 for fruit punch to 0.93 for beer). The mean of correlation coefficients between the dietary records and first questionnaire was 0.44 (range = 0.09 for yellow squash to 0.83 for beer and tea) and between the dietary records and the second questionnaire was 0.52 (range = 0.08 for spinach to 0.90 for tea). Ratios of within- to between-person variance for the 55 foods were computed using the mean four one-week dietary records for each person as replicate measurements. For most foods this ratio was greater than 1.0 (geometric mean of ratios = 1.88), ranging from 0.25 (skimmed milk) to 14.76 (spinach). Correlation coefficients comparing questionnaire and dietary record for the 55 foods were corrected for the within-person variation (mean corrected value = 0.55 for dietary record versus first questionnaire and 0.66 versus the second). Mean daily amounts of each food calculated by the questionnaire and by the dietary record were also compared; the observed differences suggested that responses to the questionnaire tended to over-represent socially desirable foods. This analysis documents the validity and reproducibility of the questionnaire for measuring specific foods and beverages, as well as the large within-person variation for food intake measured by dietary records. Differences in the degree of validity for specific foods revealed in this type of analysis can be useful in improving questionnaire design and in interpreting findings from epidemiological studies that use the instrument.},

Glutathione, and possibly other thiols, serve as reducing agents. The liver is the most important site of arsenic methylation, but most organs show arsenic methylating activity. The end metabolites are methylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). These are less reactive with tissue constituents than inorganic arsenic and readily excreted in the urine. However, reactive intermediates may be formed. Absorbed arsenate (As

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates that inorganic arsenic (iAs) can directly damage cells and result in malignant transformation with unclear complicated mechanisms. In the present study, we aimed to explore the possible molecules, pathways and therapeutic agents by using bioinformatics methods. METHODS: Microarray-based data were retrieved and analyzed to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between iAs-treated lung cells and controls. Then, the functions of DEGs were annotated and the hub genes were filtrated. The key genes were selected from the hub genes through validation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. Possible drugs were predicted by using CMAP tool. RESULTS: Two datasets (GSE33520 and GSE36684) were retrieved, and 61 up-regulated and 228 down-regulated DEGs were screened out, which were enriched in various pathways, particularly metabolism-related pathways. Among the DEGs, four hub genes including MTIF2, ACOX1, CAV1, and MRPL17, which might affect lung cancer prognosis, were selected as the key genes. Interestingly, Quinostatin was predicted to be a potential agent reversing iAs-induced lung cell malignant transformation. CONCLUSION: The present study sheds novel insights into the mechanisms of iAs-induced lung cell malignant transformation and identified several potential small agents for iAs toxicity prevention and therapy.},

Water arsenic (As) was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and urinary As [arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)] were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography-hydride-generated atomic absorption spectrometry. We used linear mixed-effects models to compute variance components and evaluate the association between UAs and selected factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The concentrations of UAs were fairly reproducible within individuals, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of 0.41, 0.35, 0.47, and 0.49 for inorganic As (InAs), MMA, DMA, and total urinary As (TUA). However, when expressed as a ratio, the percent InAs ({\%}InAs), {\%}MMA, and {\%}DMA were poorly reproducible within individuals, with ICCs of 0.16, 0.16, and 0.17, respectively. Arsenic metabolism was significantly associated with sex, exposure, age, smoking, chewing betel nut, urinary creatinine, and season. Specificity and sensitivity analyses showed that a single urine sample adequately classified a participant's urinary As profile as high or low, but TUA had only moderate specificity for correctly classifying drinking water exposures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic studies should use both urinary As concentrations and the relative proportion of UAs to minimize measurement error and to facilitate interpretation of factors that influence As metabolism.},

POPULATION AND METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, the Spanish arm of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase 3 collected information on 28 445 children in the age bracket of 6-7 years in 10 metropolitan areas (A Coru{\~{n}}a, Asturias, Barcelona, Bilbao, Cartagena, Castell{\'{o}}n, Madrid, Pamplona, San Sebasti{\'{a}}n, and Valencia) and on 31 257 adolescents in the bracket 13-14 years in 11 areas (the previously named areas plus Valladolid). An asthma symptom questionnaire was filled in by parents or the adolescents themselves. Differences in symptoms between geographic areas were analyzed by fitting a logistic regression model. The relationship between symptoms and age was analyzed by linear correlation. RESULTS: The prevalence of recent wheezing (last 12 months) ranged from 7.1{\%} to 12.9{\%} among 6-7-year-olds and from 7.1{\%} to 15.3{\%} among the 13-14-year-olds. The greatest risk of recent wheezing was observed for children in A Coru{\~{n}}a (odds ratio [OR] =1.96 in comparison with the area of lowest prevalence; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.65-2.33) and Bilbao (OR=1.83; 95{\%} CI, 1.54-2.18) and for adolescents in A Coru{\~{n}}a (OR=2.38; 95{\%} CI, 2.04-2.79) and Asturias (OR=2.37; 95{\%} CI, 2.03-2.77). A strong correlation (r=0.72) was observed between the prevalence of recent wheezing and age in each of the geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable geographic variation in the prevalence of asthma symptoms can be seen in Spain even among young children. Symptoms are more frequent in children and adolescents who live on the Spain's northern Atlantic coast.},

	abstract = {Silicon (Si) uptake has been extensively examined in rice (Oryza sativa), but it is poorly understood in other gramineous crops. We identified Low Silicon Rice 2 (Lsi2)-like Si efflux transporters from two important gramineous crops: maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Both maize and barley Lsi2 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed Si efflux transport activity. Furthermore, barley Lsi2 was able to recover Si uptake in a rice mutant defective in Si efflux. Maize and barley Lsi2 were only expressed in the roots. Expression of maize and barley Lsi2 was downregulated in response to exogenously applied Si. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the ability of roots to absorb Si and the expression levels of Lsi2 in eight barley cultivars, suggesting that Lsi2 is a key Si transporter in barley. Immunostaining showed that maize and barley Lsi2 localized only at the endodermis, with no polarity. Protein gel blot analysis indicated that maize and barley Lsi2 localized on the plasma membrane. The unique features of maize and barley Si influx and efflux transporters, including their cell-type specificity and the lack of polarity of their localization in Lsi2, indicate that these crops have a different Si uptake system from that in rice.},

	abstract = {Objective: To assess the extent of arsenic contamination of groundwater and surface water in Peru and, to evaluate the accuracy of the Arsenic Econo-Quick {\texttrademark} (EQ) kit for measuring water arsenic concentrations in the field. Methods: Water samples were collected from 151 water sources in 12 districts of Peru, and arsenic concentrations were measured in the laboratory using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The EQ field kit was validated by comparing a subset of 139 water samples analysed by laboratory measurements and the EQ kit. Findings: In 86{\%} (96/111) of the groundwater samples, arsenic exceeded the 10 $\mu$g/l arsenic concentration guideline given by the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water. In 56{\%} (62/111) of the samples, it exceeded the Bangladeshi threshold of 50 $\mu$g/l; the mean concentration being 54.5 $\mu$g/l (range: 0.1-93.1). In the Juliaca and Caracoto districts, in 96{\%} (27/28) of groundwater samples arsenic was above the WHO guideline; and in water samples collected from the section of the R{\'{i}}mac river running through Lima, all had arsenic concentrations exceeding the WHO limit. When validated against laboratory values, the EQ kit correctly identified arsenic contamination relative to the guideline in 95{\%} (106/111) of groundwater and in 68{\%} (19/28) of surface water samples. Conclusion: In several districts of Peru, drinking water shows widespread arsenic contamination, exceeding the WHO arsenic guideline. This poses a public health threat requiring further investigation and action. For groundwater samples, the EQ kit performed well relative to the WHO arsenic limit and therefore could provide a vital tool for water arsenic surveillance.},

	abstract = {Even at high concentrations, arsenic-contaminated water is translucent, tasteless,  and odorless. Yet almost every day, studies report a continually increasing plethora of toxic effects that have manifested in exposed populations throughout the world. In this article we focus on recent findings, in particular those associated with major contributions since 2006. Early life exposure, both in utero and in childhood, has been receiving increased attention, and remarkable increases in consequent mortality in young adults have been reported. New studies address the dose-response relationship between drinking-water arsenic concentrations and skin lesions, and new findings have emerged concerning arsenic and cardiovascular disease. We also review the increasing epidemiological evidence that the first step of methylation of inorganic arsenic to monomethylated arsenic (MMA) is actually an activation step rather than the first step in detoxification, as once thought. Hexavalent chromium differs from arsenic in that it discolors water, turning the water yellow at high concentrations. A controversial issue is whether chromium causes cancer when ingested. A recent publication supports the original findings in China of increased cancer mortality in a population where well water turned yellow with chromium.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a metalloid usually found in organic and inorganic forms with different oxidation states, while inorganic form (arsenite As-III and arsenate As-v) is considered to be more hazardous as compared to organic form (methylarsonate and dimethylarsinate), with mild or no toxicity in mammals. Due to an increasing trend to using arsenicals as growth promoters or for treatment purposes, the understanding of metabolism and toxicity of As gets vital importance. Its toxicity is mainly depends on oxi-reduction states (As-III or As-v) and the level of methylation during the metabolism process. Currently, the exact metabolic pathways of As have yet to be confirmed in humans and food producing animals. Oxidative methylation and glutathione conjugation is believed to be major pathways of As metabolism. Oxidative methylation is based on conversion of Arsenite in to mono-methylarsonic acid and di-methylarsenic acid in mammals. It has been confirmed that As is only methylated in the presence of glutathione or thiol compounds, suggesting that As is being methylated in trivalent states. Subsequently, non-conjugated trivalent arsenicals are highly reactive with thiol which converts the trivalent arsenicals in to less toxic pentavalent forms. The glutathione conjugate stability of As is the most important factor for determining the toxicity. It can lead to DNA damage by alerting enzyme profile and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which causes the oxidative stress. Moreover, As causes immune-dysfunction by hindering cellular and humeral immune response. The present review discussed different metabolic pathways and toxic outcomes of arsenicals in mammals which will be helpful in health risk assessment and its impact on biological world.},

	abstract = {The present work integrates concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE) (i.e. As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn) from (i) environmental media (i.e. soil, crops) and (ii) human hair. The aim was to assess whether agricultural soil and vegetable quality are related to risks to human health from different exposures pathways and if there are any signs of it in human hair. Domestic vegetable gardens in the surroundings Estarreja chemical complex (ECC), Municipality of Estarreja, central Portugal, were the selected for the current study. Data analysis of two soil fractions (2 mm and {\textless} 63 µm) and of three different vegetables (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., Solanum tuberosum, L. and Brassica oleracea, L.) samples were used. Agricultural soils in the ECC surrounding present high concentrations of As, Cu, Hg and Pb (mg/kg: up to 532, 103, 13.7 and 109, respectively). The high PTE concentrations in soils and horticultural crops are chiefly related to historical industrial activities, mostly from arsenopyrite roasting and a chloralkali plant. The assessment of risks to human health for ECC-surrounding residents (children 4--8 years old; elderly adults {\textgreater} 55 years old) showed that agricultural soil-dust ingestion induces a high-non-carcinogenic risk (HI) for As (HI up to 41 and 4.4, for children and adult, respectively), Pb (HI up to 2.5 for children) and Hg (HI up to 1.3 for children) and carcinogenic risk (CR) for As (10−3 for both age groups). Exposure through consumption of tomatoes and potatoes grown in the study soils does not present a high health hazard. However, exposure to As through consumption of cabbage presents both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks for both studied age groups (CR {\textgreater} 10−4 and HI {\textgreater} 1.1). It is likely that hair As and Hg concentrations increases in both children and adults can be related to the ingestion of agricultural soil and cabbage, and inhalation or dermal contact with contaminated soil. Nonetheless, this assumption requires further investigation, including on other potential sources of contaminants for the local population, such as dietary intake of other foodstuffs. Hair Cr content in the adult group of residents showed maximum values above the normal range for non-exposed individuals, as well as high mean and median values which may be related to the high Cr content in the studied foods. The exposure study results are in agreement with As and Hg concentrations in both children and adults hair and validate it as a biomarker of As and Hg local environmental exposure.},

	abstract = {Background Arsenic and cadmium are environmental pollutants, and although the evidence for adverse immune effects after prenatal arsenic and cadmium exposures is increasing, little is known about the underlying immunological mechanisms. Methods We investigated the relationship between prenatal arsenic and cadmium exposures and a variety of T cell subpopulations measured in cord blood for 63 participants in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Post-partum toenail concentrations of arsenic and cadmium were used as an estimate of maternal exposure during pregnancy. The characteristics of cord blood proportions of T lymphocytes and subpopulations (expression of markers for Th1, Th2, Th17, Th1Th17, induced and natural regulatory T cells and NKTs) are presented. Results In regression analyses, maternal arsenic exposure levels were inversely associated with cord blood T helper memory cells (-21{\%}, 95{\%} CI: -36{\%}, -3{\%}) and the association was found to be stronger in females. They were also inversely associated with activated T helper memory cells, particularly in males (-26{\%}, 95{\%} CI: -43{\%}, -3{\%}). Similarly, inverse associations were observed between cadmium exposure levels and activated T helper memory cells (-16{\%}, 95{\%} CI: -30{\%}, -1{\%}) and also for T helper memory cells in females (-20{\%}, 95{\%} CI: -35{\%}, -3{\%}). Conclusion The results suggest that prenatal exposures to relatively low levels of arsenic and cadmium may contribute to altered distribution of T cell populations at birth. These changes in theory, could have contributed to the previously reported immunosuppressive effects observed later in infancy/childhood.},

Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants-manganese, fluoride, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity. To coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention, we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Widespread contamination of arsenic (As) has become a global public health concern. Exposure to As causes respiratory complications. Asthma, a major respiratory complication, is increasing worldwide. However, the effect of chronic As exposure on the risk of asthma remains to be clarified. This study aims to examine the associations between As exposure (water, hair and nail As) and the risk of asthma among 842 individuals exposed to a wide range of As concentrations through drinking water in Bangladesh. Subjects' As exposure levels were measured with ICP-MS. Lung function was examined by a handheld spirometer. Characteristic features of asthma were evaluated by bronchodilator-mediated reversibility in airway obstruction and asthma-like symptoms through a structured questionnaire. Total serum immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels were measured by immunoassay. As exposure metrics showed inverse associations with lung function measures (FEV1, FEV6, and FEV1/FEV6 ratio) and positive associations with the risks of airway obstruction (AO), reversible airway obstruction (RAO), and asthma-like symptoms. The majority of AO patients (70 of 97) were RAO with one or more characteristic symptoms of asthma. Intriguingly, subjects' As exposure levels showed positive associations with total sIgE levels. Total sIgE in RAO patients was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than that in the control group. Thus the results revealed that chronic As exposure was associated with the risk of the characteristic features of asthma. Additionally the association between As exposure and subjects' total sIgE levels and an elevated level of total sIgE in RAO group suggested that As exposure-related asthma might be allergic in nature.},

This study employed in vitro gastrointestinal fluid digestion to determine bioaccessible or gastrointestinal fluid extractable arsenic concentration in rice. Thirty-one rice samples, of which 60 {\%} were grown in the United States, were purchased from food stores in New York City. Total arsenic concentrations in these samples ranged from 0.090 +/- 0.004 to 0.85 +/- 0.03 mg/kg with a mean value of 0.275 +/- 0.161 mg/kg (n = 31). Rice samples with relatively high total arsenic ({\textgreater}0.20 mg/kg, n = 18) were treated by in vitro artificial gastrointestinal fluid digestion, and the extractable arsenic ranged from 53 {\%} to 102 {\%}. The bioaccessibility of arsenic in rice decreases in the general order of extra long grain, long grain, long grain parboiled, to brown rices.},

	abstract = {Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the villi of the small intestine causing abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, or bad absorption due to gluten intolerance. The only treatment for this disease consists of a lifelong gluten free diet; this is, celiac people cannot consume products containing gluten, such as wheat, barley, and rye, but they can use rice and corn. Thus, rice flour is mainly used for the manufacturing of the basic products of this population. Unfortunately, rice can contain high contents of total (t-As) and inorganic (i-As) arsenic. The current study demonstrated that products for celiac children with a high percentage of rice contained high concentrations of arsenic (256 and 128 $\mu$g kg⁻¹). The daily intake of i-As ranged from 0.61 to 0.78 $\mu$g kg⁻¹ body weight (bw) in children up to 5 y of age; these values were below the maximum value established by the EFSA Panel (8.0 $\mu$g kg⁻¹ bw per day), but it should be considered typical of populations with a high exposure to this pollutant. Finally, legislation is needed to improve the labeling of these special rice-based foods for celiac children; label should include information about percentage, geographical origin, and cultivar of the used rice.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress (OS) is an important consequence of exposure to toxic metals but it is unclear to what extent low-level metal exposures contribute to OS in children. We examined the cross-sectional association between urinary concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) and urinary markers of OS: F2--8$\alpha$ isoprostane and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG). We also tested effect modification by dietary intakes. Of the 211 children aged 6--8 years living in Montevideo who were eligible for the study because they had at least one OS marker measured via ELISA, 143 were included in a complete-case analysis. Urinary metals were measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS: Pb, Cd) and high-performance liquid chromatography online with hydride generation ICP-MS (As-metabolites); concentrations were log2-transformed. All urinary markers were adjusted for specific gravity of urine. Two 24-h dietary recalls were conducted to estimate children's dietary intakes, including total fruit and vegetable consumption and vitamin C, zinc and fiber intake. Ordinary least square (OLS) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions were used to estimate the association between metals and each OS marker as outcome. Metal exposure was generally low: median urinary As, Cd, Pb 9.6 $\mu$g/L, 0.06 $\mu$g/L and 1.9 $\mu$g/L, respectively. Median 8-isoprostane concentration was 1.1 and 8-OHdG 39.6 ng/mL. Log2-transformed urinary As concentrations were positively associated with 8-OHdG concentrations (10.90 [3.82, 17.97]) in covariate-adjusted OLS models which also took account of exposure to Cd and Pb. In WQS, a mixture index was also associated with higher 8-OHdG (8.71 [1.12, 16.3] for each 25{\%} increase in index value), mostly driven by As exposure. There was little evidence of effect modification by dietary antioxidants. In sum, even at low-level, As exposure is associated with detectable oxidative damage to the DNA.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that rice cultivated under flooded conditions has higher concentrations of arsenic (As) but lower cadmium (Cd) compared to rice grown in unsaturated soils. To validate such effects over long terms under Mediterranean conditions a field experiment, conducted over 7 successive years was established in SW Spain. The impact of water management on rice production and grain arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) was measured, and As speciation was determined to inform toxicity evaluation. Sprinkler irrigation was compared to traditional flooding. Both irrigation techniques resulted in similar grain yields ({\~{}}3000kggrainha(-1)). Successive sprinkler irrigation over 7years decreased grain total As to one-sixth its initial concentration in the flooded system (0.55 to 0.09mgAskg(-1)), while one cycle of sprinkler irrigation also reduced grain total As by one-third (0.20mgkg(-1)). Grain inorganic As concentration increased up to 2 folds under flooded conditions compared to sprinkler irrigated fields while organic As was also lower in sprinkler system treatments, but to a lesser extent. This suggests that methylation is favored under water logging. However, sprinkler irrigation increased Cd transfer to grain by a factor of 10, reaching 0.05mgCdkg(-1) in 7years. Sprinkler systems in paddy fields seem particularly suited for Mediterranean climates and are able to mitigate against excessive As accumulation, but our evidence shows that an increased Cd load in rice grain may result.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc. Inorganic arsenic (i-As) has been related to wide-ranging health effects in children, leading to lifelong concerns. Proportionally, dietary i-As exposure dominates in regions with low arsenic drinking water. This study aims to investigate the relation between rice and seafood consumption and urinary arsenic species during childhood and to assess the proportion of urinary i-As metabolites. Urinary arsenic species concentration in 400 4-year-old children living in four geographical areas of Spain, in addition to repeated measures from 100 children at 7 years of age are included in this study. Rice and seafood products intake was collected from children's parents using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). At 4 years of age, children's urine i-As and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) concentrations increased with rice product consumption (p-value = 0.010 and 0.018, respectively), and urinary arsenobetaine (AsB) with seafood consumption (p = 0.002). Four-year-old children had a higher consumption of both rice and seafood per body weight and a higher urinary {\%}MMA (p-value = 0.001) and lower {\%} dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (p-value = 0.017). This study suggests increased dietary i-As exposure related to rice product consumption among children living in Spain, and the younger ones may be especially vulnerable to the health impacts of this exposure also considering that they might have a lower i-As methylation capacity than older children. In contrast, seafood consumption did not appear to influence the presence of potentially toxic arsenic species in this population of children.},

	abstract = {The field of environmental public health is at an important crossroad. Our current biomonitoring efforts document widespread exposure to a host of chemicals for which toxicity information is lacking. At the same time, advances in the fields of genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, genetics and epigenetics are yielding volumes of data at a rapid pace. Our ability to detect chemicals in biological and environmental media has far outpaced our ability to interpret their health relevance, and as a result, the environmental risk paradigm, in its current state, is antiquated and ill-equipped to make the best use of these new data. In light of new scientific developments and the pressing need to characterize the public health burdens of chemicals, it is imperative to reinvigorate the use of environmental epidemiology in chemical risk assessment. Two case studies of chemical assessments from the Environmental Protection Agency Integrated Risk Information System database are presented to illustrate opportunities where epidemiologic data could have been used in place of experimental animal data in dose-response assessment, or where different approaches, techniques, or studies could have been employed to better utilize existing epidemiologic evidence. Based on the case studies and what can be learned from recent scientific advances and improved approaches to utilizing human data for dose-response estimation, recommendations are provided for the disciplines of epidemiology and risk assessment for enhancing the role of epidemiologic data in hazard identification and dose-response assessment.},

Using H2O2 in the extractant to oxidize As(III) to As(V) it is possible to separate arsenobetaine from DMA, MMA and As(V) in 1.5 minutes. Such a method may be useful where a measure of total inorganic As is sufficient, for example for regulatory compliance in food or beverage testing. It is possible to separate six As species. i.e the four above and arsenocholine and As(III) in 4.5 minutes using a gradient separation. Such a method could be useful analysis of urinary arsenic species. Coupling with high sensitivity of ICP-QQQ yields equivalent or better detection limits than conventional methods with run times up to 5 times faster, which is a significant benefit for sample throughput and method development.},

Asturias (Northwest of Spain) can be considered an Hg metallogenic province with abundant epithermal-type deposits, whose paragenetic sequences include also As-rich minerals. These mines were abandoned long before the introduction of any environmental regulations to control metal release from these sources. Consequently, the environment is globally affected, as high metal concentrations have been found in soils, waters, sediments, plants, and air. In this paper, a characterization of the environmental affection caused by Hg mining in nine Asturian mine sites is presented, with particular emphasis in Hg and As contents. Hg concentrations found in the studied milieu are similar and even higher than those reported in previous studies for other mercury mining districts (mainly Almad{\'{e}}n and Idrija). Furthermore, the potential adverse health effects of exposure to these elements in the considered sites in this district have been assessed.},

RECENT FINDINGS: The health effects of environmental chemicals or air pollutants have been widely described. Often, there exists a complex mixture of different substances, potentially highly correlated with each other and with other (environmental) stressors. Single-exposure approaches do not allow disentangling effects of individual factors and fail to detect potential interactions between exposures. In the last years, sophisticated methods have been developed to investigate the joint or independent health effects of multi-pollutant mixtures or multiple environmental exposures. A classification of the most recent methods is proposed. A non-technical description of each method is provided, together with epidemiological applications and operational details for implementation with standard software.},

	abstract = {Purpose of this review This review provides a summary of statistical approaches that researchers can use to study environmental exposure mixtures. Two primary considerations are the form of the research question and the statistical tools best suited to address that question. Because the choice of statistical tools is not rigid, we make recommendations about when each tool may be most useful. Recent Findings When dimensionality is relatively low, some statistical tools yield easily interpretable estimates of effect (e.g., risk ratio, odds ratio) or intervention impacts. When dimensionality increases, it is often necessary to compromise this interpretablity in favor of identifying interesting statistical signals from noise; this requires applying statistical tools that are oriented more heavily towards dimension reduction via shrinkage and/or variable selection. Summary The study of complex exposure mixtures has prompted development of novel statistical methods. We suggest that further validation work would aid practicing researchers in choosing among existing and emerging statistical tools for studying exposure mixtures.},

	abstract = {Background The burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains unclear in many regions of the world. Objectives The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study integrated data on disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality to produce consistent, up-to-date estimates for cardiovascular burden. Methods CVD mortality was estimated from vital registration and verbal autopsy data. CVD prevalence was estimated using modeling software and data from health surveys, prospective cohorts, health system administrative data, and registries. Years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying prevalence by disability weights. Years of life lost (YLL) were estimated by multiplying age-specific CVD deaths by a reference life expectancy. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Results In 2015, there were an estimated 422.7 million cases of CVD (95{\%} uncertainty interval: 415.53 to 427.87 million cases) and 17.92 million CVD deaths (95{\%} uncertainty interval: 17.59 to 18.28 million CVD deaths). Declines in the age-standardized CVD death rate occurred between 1990 and 2015 in all high-income and some middle-income countries. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD health lost globally, as well as in each world region, followed by stroke. As SDI increased beyond 0.25, the highest CVD mortality shifted from women to men. CVD mortality decreased sharply for both sexes in countries with an SDI {\textgreater}0.75. Conclusions CVDs remain a major cause of health loss for all regions of the world. Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has been associated with dramatic declines in CVD in regions with very high SDI, but only a gradual decrease or no change in most regions. Future updates of the GBD study can be used to guide policymakers who are focused on reducing the overall burden of noncommunicable disease and achieving specific global health targets for CVD.},

	abstract = {Elevated exposure to arsenic has been suggested to be associated with atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, biochemical events underlying the arsenic-induced atherosclerosis have not yet been fully documented. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of circulating molecules involved in atherosclerosis with arsenic exposure in the individuals exposed to arsenic in Bangladesh. A total of 324 study subjects, 218 from arsenic-endemic areas and 106 from nonendemic areas in Bangladesh, were recruited. Drinking water, hair, nail, and blood samples were collected from the study subjects for analysis. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were lower in arsenic-endemic subjects than those of nonendemic subjects. Oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) levels were significantly higher in arsenic-endemic subjects than those in nonendemic subjects. All these circulating molecules showed significant correlations with arsenic exposure (water, hair, and nail arsenic concentrations), and all these relations were significant before and after adjusting for relevant covariates. Among the circulating molecules tested in this study, HDL, Ox-LDL, and CRP showed dose-response relationships with arsenic exposure. Ox-LDL/HDL ratios were increased with the increasing concentrations of arsenic in the water, hair, and nails. Furthermore, non-HDL cholesterol and TC/HDL ratios were significantly correlated with arsenic exposure before and after adjusting for relevant covariates. Thus, all the observed associations may be the major features of arsenic exposure-related atherosclerosis leading to CVD.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated whether primary and secondary arsenic methylation ratios were associated with skin lesions and whether GSTT1, GSTP1, and GSTM1 polymorphisms modify these relationships. Methods: A case-control study of 600 cases and 600 controls that were frequency matched on age and sex was conducted in Pabna, Bangladesh, in 2001-2002. Individual well water, urine, and blood samples were collected. Water arsenic concentration was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Urinary arsenic speciation was determined using high performance liquid chromatography hydride with generator atomic absorption spectrometry and ICP-MS. Genotyping was conducted using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and TaqMan. Results: A 10-fold increase in primary methylation ratio [monomethylarsonic acid (MMA)/(arsenite + arsenate) was associated with a 1.50-fold increased risk of skin lesions (multivariate odds ratio = 1.50; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.00-2.26). We observed significant interaction on the multiplicative scale between GSTT1 wildtype and secondary methylation ratio [dimethylarsinic acid/MMA; likelihood ratio test (LRT), p = 0.01]. No significant interactions were observed for GSTM1 or GSTP1 or for primary mathylation ratios. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that increasing primary methylation ratios are associated with an increase in risk of arsenic-related skin lesions. The interaction between GSTT1 wildtype and secondary methylation ratio modifies risk of skin lesions among arsenic-exposed individuals.},

@article{Ljung2007,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the scientific background for the current health-based World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value for manganese in drinking water. DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: The initial starting point was the background document for the development of the WHO's guideline value for manganese in drinking water as well as other regulations and recommendations on manganese intake levels. Data referred to in these documents were traced back to the original research papers. In addition, we searched for scientific reports on manganese exposure and health effects. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current health-based guideline value for manganese in drinking water is based partly on debatable assumptions, where information from previous reports has been used without revisiting original scientific articles. Presently, preparation of common infant formulas with water containing manganese concentrations equivalent to the WHO guideline value will result in exceeding the maximum manganese concentration for infant formula. However, there are uncertainties about how this maximum value was derived. Concurrently, there is increasing evidence of negative neurologic effects in children from excessive manganese exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing number of studies reporting associations between neurologic symptoms and manganese exposure in infants and children, in combination with the questionable scientific background data used in setting the manganese guideline value for drinking water, certainly warrant a re-evaluation of the guideline value. Further research is needed to understand the causal relationship between manganese exposure and children's health, and to enable an improved risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Emerging data indicate that rice consumption may lead to potentially harmful arsenic exposure. However, few human data are available, and virtually none exist for vulnerable periods such as pregnancy. Here we document a positive association between rice consumption and urinary arsenic excretion, a biomarker of recent arsenic exposure, in 229 pregnant women. At a 6-mo prenatal visit, we collected a urine sample and 3-d dietary record for water, fish/seafood, and rice. We also tested women's home tap water for arsenic, which we combined with tap water consumption to estimate arsenic exposure through water. Women who reported rice intake (n = 73) consumed a median of 28.3 g/d, which is ∼0.5 cup of cooked rice each day. In general linear models adjusted for age and urinary dilution, both rice consumption (g, dry mass/d) and arsenic exposure through water ($\mu$g/d) were significantly associated with natural log-transformed total urinary arsenic ($\beta$rice = 0.009, $\beta$water = 0.028, both P {\textless} 0.0001), as well as inorganic arsenic, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid (each P {\textless} 0.005). Based on total arsenic, consumption of 0.56 cup/d of cooked rice was comparable to drinking 1 L/d of 10 $\mu$g As/L water, the current US maximum contaminant limit. US rice consumption varies, averaging ∼0.5 cup/d, with Asian Americans consuming an average of {\textgreater}2 cups/d. Rice arsenic content and speciation also vary, with some strains predominated by dimethylarsinic acid, particularly those grown in the United States. Our findings along with others indicate that rice consumption should be considered when designing arsenic reduction strategies in the United States.},

Sample preparation, which involved only 5 times dilution with addition of Triton X-100, Antifoam B, and l-cysteine, suppressed excessive foaming in a hydride generator. Calibration slopes for whole blood and blood plasma spiked with arsenate, monomethylarsonate, and dimethylarsinate at 0.25-1 $\mu$g L-1 As and 0.025-0.1 $\mu$g L-1 As for AAS and ICPMS detection, respectively, did not differ from slopes in aqueous solutions. HG-CT-AAS was used to analyze samples with elevated levels of arsenic species-blood plasma from patients treated with arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia and whole blood from mice fed an arsenic-containing diet. A good agreement between results of the direct analysis and analysis after mild digestion in phosphoric acid proved the good efficiency of the direct HG-CT procedure for the arsenic species in these types of biological samples. In the next step, plasma and whole blood from healthy donors that were spiked with the plasma from leukemia patients at levels of 0.15-0.4 $\mu$g L-1 As were analyzed by direct HG-CT-ICPMS. Good recoveries for all species even at these low levels (88-104{\%}) were obtained. Limits of detection in blood and plasma were 0.014 $\mu$g L-1 for inorganic arsenic and below 0.002 $\mu$g L-1 As for methylated arsenic species. Thus, the ultrasensitive direct HG-CT-ICPMS method is uniquely suited for analyses of blood plasma and whole blood from individuals at low exposure levels.},

Research shows that rice can take up and store inorganic arsenic during cultivation, and rice is considered to be one of the major routes of exposure to inorganic arsenic, a class I carcinogen for humans. Here, we report the use of a screening method based on the Gutzeit methodology to detect inorganic arsenic (iAs) in rice within 1 h. After optimization, 30 rice commodities from the United Kingdom market were tested with the field method and were compared to the reference method (high-performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, HPLC-ICP-MS). In all but three rice samples, iAs compound can be determined. The results show no bias for iAs using the field method. Results obtained show quantification limits of about 50 $\mu$g kg(-1), a good reproducibility for a field method of $\pm$12{\%}, and only a few false positives and negatives ({\textless}10{\%}) could only be recorded at the 2015 European Commission (EC) guideline for baby rice of 100 $\mu$g kg(-1), while none were recorded at the maximum level suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and implemented by the EC for polished and white rice of 200 $\mu$g kg(-1). The method is reliable, fast, and inexpensive; hence, it is suggested to be used as a screening method in the field for preselection of rice which violates legislative guidelines.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to arsenic via drinking water is a significant environmental issue affecting millions of people around the world. Exposure to arsenic during foetal development has been shown to impair somatic growth and increase the risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to determine if in utero exposure to low dose arsenic via drinking water is capable of altering lung growth and postnatal lung mechanics.Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were given drinking water containing 0, 10 (current World Health Organisation (WHO) maximum contaminant level) or 100$\mu$g/L arsenic from gestational day 8 to birth. Birth outcomes and somatic growth were monitored. Plethysmography and the forced oscillation technique were used to collect measurements of lung volume, lung mechanics, pressure-volume curves and the volume dependence of lung mechanics in male and female offspring at two, four, six and eight weeks of age.Results: In utero exposure to low dose arsenic via drinking water resulted in low birth weight and impaired parenchymal lung mechanics during infancy. Male offspring were more susceptible to the effects of arsenic on growth and lung mechanics than females. All alterations to lung mechanics following in utero arsenic exposure were recovered by adulthood.Conclusions: Exposure to arsenic at the current WHO maximum contaminant level in utero impaired somatic growth and the development of the lungs resulting in alterations to lung mechanics during infancy. Deficits in growth and lung development in early life may contribute to the increased susceptibility of developing chronic respiratory disease in arsenic exposed human populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Ramsey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

A model of causation that describes causes in terms of sufficient causes and their component causes illuminates important principles such as multi-causality, the dependence of the strength of component causes on the prevalence of complementary component causes, and interaction between component causes. Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

	abstract = {Human biomonitoring (HBM), defined as the measurement of concentrations of chemicals or of their metabolites in human biological matrices, is considered the method of choice for determining internal exposures in individuals. HBM is part of environmental exposure surveillance systems in several countries. In 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment promoted BIOAMBIENT. ES project, a national-level HBM study on environmental pollutants carried out in Spain to estimate levels of heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and other substances on the Spanish active workforce. BIOAMBIENT. ES is a nationwide cross-sectional study, with a stratified cluster sampling designed to cover all geographical areas, sex and occupational sectors, and aimed to obtain a representative sample of the Spanish workforce. Participants were recruited among people residing in Spain for 5 years or more, which underwent their annual occupational medical check-up in the health facilities of the Societies for Prevention of IBERMUTUAMUR, MUTUALIA, MC-PREVENCI{\'{O}}N, MUGATRA, UNIMAT PREVENCI{\'{O}}N, and PREVIMAC (March 2009-July 2010). A total of 1,892 subjects fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, donated biological samples (1,880 blood, 1,770 urine, and 577 hair) and completed a short self-administrated epidemiological questionnaire on environmental and lifestyle-related exposures. Additionally, clinical information from participant's health exams was obtained. This project will provide a first overview of the body burden of selected pollutants in a representative sample of the Spanish-occupied population. This information will be useful to establish reference values of the studied population and, eventually, to evaluate temporal trends and the effectiveness of environmental and health policies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Urinary arsenic is generally considered as the most reliable indicator of recent exposure to inorganic arsenic and is used as the main bio-marker of exposure. However, due to the different toxicity of arsenic compounds, speciation of arsenic in urine is generally considered to be more convenient for health risk assessment than measuring total arsenic concentration. Additionally, it can give valuable information about the metabolism of arsenic species within the body. In our study, for exposed group-42 urine samples were collected from Datterhat (South) village of Madaripur district, Bangladesh and an average arsenic concentration in their drinking water was 376 mug/L (range 118 to 620 mug/L). For control group, 27 urine samples were collected from a non-affected district, Badhadamil village of Medinipur district, West Bengal, India, where arsenic concentration in their drinking water is below 3 mug/L. The arsenic species in the urine were separated and quantified by using HPLC-ICP-MS. The sum of inorganic arsenic and its metabolites was also determined by FI-HG-AAS. Results indicate that average total urinary arsenic metabolites in children's urine is higher than adults and total arsenic excretion per kg body weight is also higher for children than adults. For arsenic species between adults and children, it has been observed that inorganic arsenic (In-As) in average is 2.36{\%} and NIMA is 6.55{\%} lower for children than adults while DMA is 8.91{\%} (average) higher in children than adults. The efficiency of the methylation process is also assessed by the ratio between urinary concentration of putative product and putative substrate of the arsenic metabolic pathway. Higher values mean higher methylation capacity. Results show the values of the MMA/In-As ratio for adults and children are 0.93 and 0.74 respectively. These results indicate that first reaction of the metabolic pathway is more active in adults than children. But a significant increase in the values of the DMA/MMA ratio in children than adults of exposed group (8.15 vs. 4.11 respectively) indicates 2nd methylation step is more active in children than adults. It has also been shown that the distribution of the values of DMA/MMA ratio to exposed group decrease with increasing age (2nd methylation process). Thus from these results we may infer that children retain less arsenic in their body than adults. This may also explain why children do not show skin lesions compared to adults when both are drinking same contaminated water.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the effect of coal-burning arsenic (As) exposure on lung function and the potential underlying mechanisms, a total of 217 As-exposed subjects and 75 reference subjects were recruited into this study. Hair arsenic (H--As), pulmonary function tests, and serum inflammatory markers CC16, SP-A, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 were evaluated. Residents from As-exposed areas showed higher H--As concentrations (median 0.25 $\mu$g/g) than subjects from the reference area (median 0.14 $\mu$g/g). Large reductions in lung function parameters were noted in the As-exposed group. A significant negative correlation was observed between H--As concentrations and lung function. Specifically, monotonic negative dose-response relationships were observed between H--As and FEV1({\%}), FEV1/FVC ({\%}) and FEF75 ({\%}) (all P {\textless} 0.05), while the associations between H--As and FVC ({\%}), FEF25 ({\%}), and FEF50 ({\%}) were nonlinear (P for nonlinearity = 0.03, 0.001, 0.01, respectively). In addition, there was a direct positive relationship between H--As and the inflammatory response. Alterations in inflammatory biomarkers (CC16, SP-A, MMP-9, and MMP-9/TIMP-1) were significantly associated with As-induced lung function impairment. Thus, this population-based study revealed that As exposure has significant toxic effects on lung function and increased inflammation may occur during this toxic process. We provide scientific evidence for an As-induced alteration in inflammatory biomarkers and pulmonary damage in an As-exposed population. The results of this study can inform risk assessment and risk control processes in relation to human As exposure in coal-burning arsenicosis areas.},

The general population is predominantly exposed to inorganic tin from the consumption of canned food and beverages. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands (RIVM) has established a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for chronic exposure to inorganic tin based on a NOAEL of 20 mg/kg bw per day from a 2-year feeding study in rats. Using a urinary excretion fraction (0.25{\%}) from a controlled human study along with a TDI value of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day, a Biomonitoring Equivalent (BE) was derived for urinary tin (26 $\mu$g/g creatinine or 20 $\mu$g/L urine). The geometric mean and the 95th percentile tin urine concentrations of the general population in U.S. (0.705 and 4.5 $\mu$g/g creatinine) and France (0.51 and 2.28 $\mu$g/g creatinine) are below the BE associated with the TDI, indicating that the population exposure to inorganic tin is below the exposure guidance value of 0.2 mg/kg bw per day. Overall, the robustness of pharmacokinetic data forming the basis of the urinary BE development is medium. The availability of internal dose and kinetic data in the animal species forming the basis of the assessment could improve the overall confidence in the present assessment.},

To investigate whether phytoremediation can reduce As uptake by rice, the As hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata was grown in five contaminated paddy soils in a pot experiment. Over a 9-month period P. vittata removed 3.5-11.4{\%} of the total soil As, and decreased phosphate-extractable As and soil pore water As by 11-38{\%} and 18-77{\%}, respectively. Rice grown following P. vittata had significantly lower As concentrations in straw and grain, being 17-82{\%} and 22-58{\%} of those in the control, respectively. Phytoremediation also resulted in significant changes in As speciation in rice grain by greatly decreasing the concentration of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). In two soils the concentration of inorganic As in rice grain was decreased by 50-58{\%}. The results demonstrate an effective stripping of bioavailable As from contaminated paddy soils thus reducing As uptake by rice.},

	abstract = {The5 use of arsenic (As) contaminated groundwater for irrigation of crops has resulted in elevated concentrations of arsenic in agricultural soils in Bangladesh, West Bengal (India), and elsewhere. Paddy rice (Oryza sativa L) is the main agricultural crop grown in the arsenic-affected areas of Bangladesh. There is, therefore, concern regarding accumulation of arsenic in rice grown those soils. A greenhouse study was conducted to examine the effects of arsenic-contaminated irrigation water on the growth of rice and uptake and speciation of arsenic. Treatments of the greenhouse experiment consisted of two phosphate doses and seven different arsenate concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 mg of As L-1 applied regularly throughout the 170=day post-transplantation growing period until plants were ready for harvesting. Increasing the concentration of arsenate in irrigation water significantly decreased plant height, grain yield, the number of filled grains, grain weight, and root biomass, while the arsenic concentrations in root, straw, and rice husk increased significantly. Concentrations of arsenic in rice grain did not exceed the food hygiene concentration limit (1.0 mg of As kg-1 dry weight), The concentrations of arsenic in rice straw (up to 91,8 mg kg-1 for the highest As treatment) were of the same order of magnitude as root arsenic concentrations (up to 107.5 mg kg-1), suggesting that arsenic can be readily translocated to the shoot. While not covered by food hygiene regulations, rice straw is used as cattle feed in many countries including Bangladesh. The high arsenic concentrations may have the potential for adverse health effects on the cattle and an increase of arsenic exposure in humans via the plant-animal-human pathway. Arsenic concentrations in rice plant parts except husk were not affected by application of phosphate. As the concentration of arsenic in the rice grain was low, arsenic speciation was performed only on rice straw to predict the risk associated with feeding contaminated straw to the cattle. Speciation of arsenic in tissues (using HPLC-ICP-MS) revealed that the predominant species present in straw was arsenate followed by arsenite and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), As DMAA is only present at low concentrations, it is unlikely this will greatly alter the toxicity of arsenic present in rice.},

@techreport{Gamble2005,
	abstract = {Urinary creatinine is almost universally employed to adjust concentrations of urinary analytes for variations in hydration status. In the February 2005 issue of EHP, Barr et al. used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to establish reference ranges for urinary creatinine for specific age and demographic categories (Barr et al. 2005). They reported that the significant predic-tors of urinary creatinine concentrations include age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and fat-free mass. Although these indicators have been known for many years, the unintentional adjustment for these covariates when urinary metabolites are expressed per gram creatinine can have profound effects on the interpretation of data. The fact that these effects are often under-appreciated or even unnoticed renders this paper highly relevant to exposure assessment and well worth revisiting. In our studies of arsenic methylation and one-carbon metabolism , we have noted several additional complications when expressing urinary arsenic as micrograms per gram creatinine. Note that one-carbon metabolism refers to the folate-dependent biochemical pathway responsible for methylation of DNA, arsenic, and hundreds of other substrates. Our study in Bangladesh on 1,650 adults revealed that urinary creatinine concentrations are significantly correlated with plasma folate concentrations-particularly among males, who had a higher prevalence of folate deficiency than females in Bangladesh (Gamble et al. 2005). Although this association had not been previously reported, it is not surprising considering that the formation of creatine from methylation of guanidino-acetate accounts for approximately 75{\%} of all folate-dependent transmethylation reactions (Mudd and Poole 1975) and that crea-tine is the direct precursor of creatinine. In some analyses, adjusting urinary arsenic for creatinine obscured correlations between folate and arsenic metabolism. In other analyses, correlations between folate and arsenic/creatinine were due in part to the associations between folate and creati-nine. Correct interpretation of the data would not be possible without considering the impact of the correlation between uri-nary creatinine and plasma folate. As did Barr et al. (2005), we decided to include uri-nary creatinine in the statistical models as a separate independent variable. However, because of the intimate link between crea-tine metabolism and one-carbon metabolism , inclusion of urinary creatinine in some models resulted in overcontrolling for the effects of folate and homocysteine, our variables of interest. Thus, expression of total urinary arsenic per gram creatinine runs the risk of confounding relationships between total urinary arsenic and arsenic metabolism. Adjusting for the specific gravity of urine was not useful because it is so highly correlated with urinary creatinine. In summary, we concur with Barr et al. (2005) that urinary creatinine should be included in multiple regression models as a separate independent variable; in addition, the role of one-carbon metabolism as a pre-dictor of urinary creatinine should also be considered in interpreting results. Specifically, we routinely test if urinary creatinine itself is a predictor of the outcomes of interest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, environmental pollution caused by small-scale domestic smelting of automobile batteries into lead ingot is a growing concern. The village of Nghia Lo is a smelting craft village located roughly 25 km southeast of Hanoi in the Red River Delta. Despite the concern of toxic metal exposure in the village, biomonitoring among susceptible populations, such as children, has not been previously conducted. The aim of this study was to determine the body burden of toxic metals in children residing in a smelting craft village.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Twenty children from Nghia Lo, Vietnam, ages 18 months to four years were selected for capillary whole blood and toenail biomonitoring. Whole blood lead levels (BLLs) were measured using a portable lead analyzer, and toenail levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and mercury were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The findings show that all of the 20 children had detectable BLLs, and every child had levels that exceeded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline level of 5 $\mu$g/dL. Eighty percent of tested subjects had BLLs higher than 10 $\mu$g/dL. Five children (25{\%}) had BLLs greater than 45 $\mu$g/dL, the level of recommended medical intervention. In addition to blood lead, all of the children had detectable levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and mercury in toenail samples. Notably, average toenail lead, manganese, and mercury levels were 157 $\mu$g/g, 7.41 $\mu$g/g, and 2.63 $\mu$g/g respectively, well above levels previously reported in children. Significant Spearman's rank correlations showed that there were relationships between blood and toenail lead levels (r = 0.65, p {\textless} 0.05), toenail levels of lead and cadmium (r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.05), and toenail levels of manganese and chromium (r = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.001). Linear regression showed that reducing the distance to the nearest active smelter by half was associated with a 116{\%} increase in BLL (p {\textless} 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that children in battery recycling and smelting craft villages in Vietnam are co-exposed to toxic metals.

Our objective was to identify opportunities for studying chemicals and child health using existing or future ECHO chemical exposure data. We described chemical-related information collected by ECHO cohorts and reviewed ECHO-relevant literature on exposure routes, sources, and environmental and human monitoring. Fifty-six ECHO cohorts have existing or planned chemical biomonitoring data for mothers or children. Environmental phenols/parabens, phthalates, metals/metalloids, and tobacco biomarkers are each being measured by ≥15 cohorts, predominantly during pregnancy and childhood, indicating ample opportunities to study child health outcomes. Cohorts are collecting questionnaire data on multiple exposure sources and conducting environmental monitoring including air, dust, and water sample collection that could be used for exposure assessment studies. To supplement existing chemical data, we recommend biomonitoring of emerging chemicals, nontargeted analysis to identify novel chemicals, and expanded measurement of chemicals in alternative biological matrices and dust samples. ECHO's rich data and samples represent an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate environmental chemical research to improve the health of US children.},

	abstract = {Silicon is an important nutrient for the optimal growth and sustainable production of rice. Rice accumulates up to 10{\%} silicon in the shoot, and this high accumulation is required to protect the plant from multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene, Lsi1, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1. This gene is constitutively expressed in the roots. The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells. Expression of Lsi2 in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that Lsi2 is a silicon efflux transporter. The identification of this silicon transporter revealed a unique mechanism of nutrient transport in plants: having an influx transporter on one side and an efflux transporter on the other side of the cell to permit the effective transcellular transport of the nutrients.},

	abstract = {Background: Arsenic is a unique human carcinogen in that it causes lung cancer by exposure through ingestion (in drinking water) as well as through inhalation. Less is known about nonmalignant pulmonary disease after exposure to arsenic in drinking water. Methods: We recruited 108 subjects with arsenic-caused skin lesions and 150 subjects without lesions from a population survey of over 7000 people in an arsenic-exposed region in West Bengal, India. Thirty-eight study participants who reported at least 2 years of chronic cough underwent high-resolution computed tomography (CT); these scans were read by investigators in India and the United States without knowledge of the presence or absence of skin lesions. Results: The mean ($\pm$ standard deviation) bronchiectasis severity score was 3.4 ($\pm$ 3.6) in the 27 participants with skin lesions and 0.9 ($\pm$ 1.6) in the 11 participants without these lesions. In subjects who reported chronic cough, CT evidence of bronchiectasis was found in 18 (67{\%}) participants with skin lesions and 3 (27{\%}) subjects without skin lesions. Overall, subjects with arsenic-caused skin lesions had a 10-fold increased prevalence of bronchiectasis compared with subjects who did not have skin lesions (adjusted odds ratio = 10; 95{\%} confidence interval = 2.7-37). Conclusions: These results suggest that, in addition to being a cause of lung cancer, ingestion of high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water may be a cause of bronchiectasis.

	abstract = {The large disparity between arsenic concentrations in drinking water and urine remains unexplained. This study aims to evaluate predictors of urinary arsenic in a population exposed to low concentrations ({\textless}= 50 mu g/l) of arsenic in drinking water. Urine and drinking water samples were collected from a subsample (n=343) of a population enrolled in a bladder cancer case control study in southeastern Michigan. Total arsenic in water and arsenic species in urine were determined using ICP-MS: arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenite (As[III]), arsenate (As[V]), methylarsenic acid (MMA[V]), and dimethylarsenic acid (DMAM). The sum of As[III], As[V], MMA[V], and DMA[V] was denoted as SumAs. Dietary information was obtained through a self-reported food intake questionnaire. Log(10)-transformed drinking water arsenic concentration at home was a significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) predictor of SumAs (R-2 = 0.18). Associations improved (R-2=0.29, P {\textless} 0.0001) when individuals with less than 1 mu g/l of arsenic in drinking water were removed and further improved when analyses were applied to individuals who consumed amounts of home drinking water above the median volume (R-2 = 0.40, P {\textless} 0.0001). A separate analysis indicated that AsB and DMA[V] were significantly correlated with fish and shellfish consumption, which may suggest that seafood intake influences DMA[V] excretion. The Spearman correlation between arsenic concentration in toenails and SumAs was 0.36 and between arsenic concentration in toenails and arsenic concentration in water was 0.42. Results show that arsenic exposure from drinking water consumption is an important determinant of urinary arsenic concentrations, even in a population exposed to relatively low levels of arsenic in drinking water, and suggest that seafood intake may influence urinary DMA[V] concentrations.

@article{Tsuji2014,
	abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing an integrated assessment of non-cancer and cancer risk assessment of inorganic arsenic (iAs). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in association with iAs exposure has been examined in a number of studies and provides a basis for evaluating a reference dose (RfD) for assessing potential non-cancer health risks of arsenic exposure. In this systematic review of low-level iAs exposure (i.e., {\textless}100-150. ??g/L arsenic water concentration) and CVD in human populations, 13 cohort and case-control studies from the United States, Taiwan, Bangladesh, and China were identified and critically examined for evidence for derivation of a RfD. Eight cross-sectional and ecological studies from the United States were also examined for additional information. Prospective cohort data from Bangladesh provided the strongest evidence for determining the point of departure in establishing a candidate RfD based on a combined endpoint of mortality from "ischemic heart disease and other heart diseases." This study as well as the overall literature supported a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 100. ??g/L for arsenic in water, which was equivalent to an iAs dose of 0.009. mg/kg-day (based on population-specific water consumption rates and dietary iAs intake). The study population was likely sensitive to arsenic toxicity because of nutritional deficiencies affecting arsenic methylation and one-carbon metabolism, as well as increasing CVD risk. Evidence is less clear on the interaction of CVD risk factors in the United States (e.g., diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) with arsenic at low doses. Potential uncertainty factors up to 3 resulted in a RfD for CVD in the range of 0.003-0.009. mg/kg-day. Although caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to the U.S. general population, these doses allow a margin of exposure that is 10-30 times the current RfD derived by EPA (based on skin lesions in Southwest Taiwan). These findings suggest that the current EPA RfD is protective of CVD. ?? 2014.},

Here, we report a consecutive investigation on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 408 children who are living in the Sonargoan Thana of Bangladesh (two age groups: 9 and 10 years; 4 and 5 years) were exposed to high levels of As in the groundwater.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Urine and water samples were collected to assess As exposure. The IQ of the children was estimated using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. Information on parents' socioeconomic status (SES) was collected as confounding factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results indicate that As exposure was responsible for a lower IQ. The concentration of urinary As ([As]u) was associated with reduced intellectual function in a dose-response manner. A stronger association was found between reduced intellectual function (IQ) and [As]u than the level of As in the drinking water [As]w. There was no association between verbal IQ scores and [As]u of children in early childhood (aged 4 and 5 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Based on these results, we conclude that current levels of As in the urine ([As]u), which we considered to reflect recent exposure to As from all possible sources, including groundwater, food, among others, were negatively associated to the IQ of the children tested, and that this adverse effect of As may also gradually accumulate over time among the poor.},

To explore the possible underlying epigenetic mechanisms, a nested case-control study was conducted within the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study by randomly selecting 46 non-smoker and non-diabetic White participants with low (N=23) and high (N=23) As exposure based on toenail total As measures at examination year 2. We conducted methylomic profiling of white blood cell (WBC) DNA collected at examination year 15 using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and performed association tests using multiple linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, and estimated WBC proportions. We observed 22 CpG sites with methylation levels associated with high As exposure at a nominal significance level of 10(-4). However, the statistical significance disappeared after correction for multiple testing. Some genes annotated by these 22 CpG sites are known to be involved in As-associated diseases.

To estimate potential health risks of inorganic arsenic, the apportionment of exposure among sources of inorganic arsenic is critical. In this study, daily inorganic arsenic intake of U.S. adults from food, water, and soil ingestion and from airborne particle inhalation was estimated. To account for variations in exposure across the U.S., a Monte Carlo approach was taken using simulations for 100,000 individuals representing the age, gender, and county of residence of the U.S. population based on census data. Our analysis found that food is the greatest source of inorganic arsenic intake and that drinking water is the next highest contributor. Inhalation of airborne arsenic-containing particles and inges- tion of arsenic-containing soils were negligible contributors. The exposure is best represented by the ranges of inorganic arsenic intake (at the 10th and 90th percen- tiles), which were 1.8 to 11.4 µg/day for males and 1.3 to 9.4 µg/day for females. Regional differences in inorganic arsenic exposure were due mostly to consumption of drinking water containing differing inorganic arsenic content rather than to food preferences.},

@article{Rauh2006,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos on 3-year neurodevelopment and behavior in a sample of inner-city minority children. METHODS. As part of an ongoing prospective cohort study in an inner-city minority population, neurotoxicant effects of prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos were evaluated in 254 children through the first 3 years of life. This report examined cognitive and motor development at 12, 24, and 36 months (measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and child behavior at 36 months (measured with the Child Behavior Checklist) as a function of chlorpyrifos levels in umbilical cord plasma. RESULTS. Highly exposed children (chlorpyrifos levels of {\textgreater}6.17 pg/g plasma) scored, on average, 6.5 points lower on the Bayley Psychomotor Development Index and 3.3 points lower on the Bayley Mental Development Index at 3 years of age compared with those with lower levels of exposure. Children exposed to higher, compared with lower, chlorpyrifos levels were also significantly more likely to experience Psychomotor Development Index and Mental Development Index delays, attention problems, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems, and pervasive developmental disorder problems at 3 years of age. CONCLUSIONS. The adjusted mean 36-month Psychomotor Development Index and Mental Development Index scores of the highly and lower exposed groups differed by only 7.1 and 3.0 points, respectively, but the proportion of delayed children in the high-exposure group, compared with the low-exposure group, was 5 times greater for the Psychomotor Development Index and 2.4 times greater for the Mental Development Index, increasing the number of children possibly needing early intervention services.

	abstract = {Background: Little is known about the quality of drinking water in US correctional facilities (e.g. detention centers, prisons, jails, etc.). Our objective was to determine if incarcerated persons are at risk for chronic, elevated arsenic exposure relative to the non-incarcerated US population, particularly in the Southwestern US where public water and groundwater arsenic concentrations are high compared to the rest of the US. Methods: We analyzed 230,158 arsenic monitoring records from 37,086 community water systems (CWSs) from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Third Six Year Review of Contaminant Occurrence dataset (covering 2006--2011). We compared six-year average arsenic concentrations and the odds of exceeding the EPA's 10 $\mu$g/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for CWSs exclusively serving correctional facilities versus all other CWSs in the Southwestern US, where groundwater arsenic concentrations are high. Results: Average six-year water arsenic concentrations were higher for Southwestern correctional facility CWSs (6.41 $\mu$g/L, 95{\%} CI 3.48, 9.34) compared to all other Southwestern CWSs (3.11 $\mu$g/L, 95{\%} CI 2.97, 3.24) and to other CWSs across the rest of the US (1.39 $\mu$g/L, 95{\%} CI 1.35, 1.42). In the Southwest, 26.1{\%} (N = 6) of correctional facility CWSs versus 5.8{\%} (509) of other CWSs reported six-year arsenic averages exceeding 10 $\mu$g/L, corresponding to an odds ratio of 5.70 (95{\%} confidence interval 2.24, 14.52). Correctional facility CWSs in the Southwest were also more likely to report six-year averages exceeding 5 $\mu$g/L (the MCL for New Jersey and New Hampshire, N = 8, odds ratio 2.77, 95{\%} CI 1.17, 6.54). Discussion: Persons incarcerated in the Southwestern US were at disproportionate risk of elevated drinking water arsenic exposure and related disease from 2006 to 2011. Strict enforcement of EPA regulations and additional technical and financial support for CWSs serving correctional facilities in the Southwest is necessary to protect the health and human rights of incarcerated persons.},

We aimed to summarize the available data and to know whether the Mediterranean setting modifies this association. METHODS: The literature search, up to May 2012, was on epidemiological studies in the general population of children assessing whether adherence to Mediterranean diet (measured as a score) was associated with the prevalence of 'current wheeze'; 'current severe wheeze'; or 'asthma ever'. Odds ratios (OR) of the eight included studies compared the highest tertile of the score with the lowest. Random-effects meta-analyses for the whole group of studies and stratified by Mediterranean setting (centers {\textless}100 Km from the Mediterranean coast) were performed. Differences between strata were assessed using the Q test. RESULTS: For 'current wheeze', there was a negative significant association with the highest tertile of Mediterranean diet score (OR 0.85, 95{\%} CI 0.75-0.98; p = 0.02), driven by Mediterranean centers (0.79, 0.66-0.94, p = 0.009), although the difference with the non-Mediterranean centers (0.91, 0.78-1.05, p = 0.18) was not significant. The results for 'current severe wheeze' were as follows: 0.82, 0.55-1.22, p = 0.330 (all); 0.66, 0.48-0.90, p = 0.008 (Mediterranean); and 0.99, 0.79-1.25, p = 0.95 (non-Mediterranean); with the difference between regions being significant. For 'asthma ever', the associations were as follows: 0.86, 0.78-0.95, p = 0.004 (all); 0.86, 0.74-1.01, p = 0.06 (Mediterranean); 0.86, 0.75-0.98; p = 0.027 (non-Mediterranean); with the difference between regions being negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet tended to be associated with lower occurrence of the three respiratory outcomes. For current and current severe wheeze, the association was mainly driven by the results in Mediterranean populations.},

The distribution of metals in the environment is governed by the properties of the metal and influences of environmental factors (Khlifi {\&} Hamza-Chaffai, 2010). Of the 92 naturally occurring elements, approximately 30 metals and metalloids are potentially toxic to humans, Be, B, Li, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, Cs, Ba, W, Pt, Au, Hg, Pb, and Bi.

Heavy metals enter the environment by natural and anthropogenic means. Such sources include: natural weathering of the earth's crust, mining, soil erosion, industrial discharge, urban runoff, sewage effluents, pest or disease control agents applied to plants, air pollution fallout, and a number of others (Ming-Ho, 2005). Although some individuals are primarily exposed to these contaminants in the workplace, for most people the main route of exposure to these toxic elements is through the diet (food and water).

	abstract = {Epidemiological evidence has indicated that arsenic and cigarette smoking exposure act synergistically to increase the incidence of lung cancer. Since oxidative damage of DNA has been linked to cancer, our hypothesis is that aerosolized arsenic and cigarette smoke work synergistically to increase oxidative stress and increase DNA oxidation in the lung. To test this hypothesis male Syrian golden hamsters were exposed to room air (control), aerosolized arsenic compounds (3.2 mg/m3 for 30 minutes), cigarette smoke (5 mg/m3 for 30 minutes), or both smoke and arsenic. Exposures were for 5 days/week for 5 or 28-days. Animals were sacrificed one day after the last exposure. In the 28-day group, glutathione levels and DNA oxidation (8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG)) were determined. Our results show that in the 28-day arsenic/smoke group there was a significant decrease in both the reduced and total glutathione levels compared with arsenic or smoke alone. This correlated with a 5-fold increase in DNA oxidation as shown by HPLC. Immunohistochemical localization of 8-oxo-dG showed increase staining in nuclei of airway epithelium and subadjacent interstitial cells. These results show that dual exposure of arsenic and cigarette smoke at environmentally relevant levels can act synergistically to cause DNA damage. {\textcopyright} 2006, SAGE Publications.

For each study we collected the first author's last name, publication year, country of origin, study design, characteristics of participants (sample size, age and gender), the variables incorporated into the multivariable analyses, and OR of psoriasis associated with diabetes along with the corresponding 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). From the data provided in each article, crude OR was also calculated. RESULTS: 42 observational studies (in 37 articles) were identified for the final analysis. The pooled OR from random effects analysis was determined to be 1.76 (95{\%} CI, 1.59-1.96). The highest risk was for patients suffering from PsA (OR: 2.18, 95{\%} CI, 1-36-3.50) We also observed a dose-effect in the risk of suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus as patients considered as having severe psoriasis had higher (OR: 2.10, 95{\%} CI, 1.73-2.55) risk than the pooled OR. We perform meta-regression and sensitivity analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity among the studies and determine how they would influence the estimates and found no significative influence in the results of the meta-analyses CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the association between psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Well arsenic levels above the EPA limit occur in our U.S. study area and are of particular concern for pregnant women and infants. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether in utero arsenic exposure affects the risk of infections and respiratory symptoms over the first year of life. METHODS: We prospectively obtained information on infant infections and symptoms, including their duration and treatment (n = 412) at 4, 8 and 12 months using a parental telephone survey. Using generalized estimating equation models adjusted for potential confounders, we evaluated the association between maternal pregnancy urinary arsenic and infant infections and symptoms over the first year. RESULTS: Each doubling of maternal urinary arsenic was related to increases in the total number of infections requiring prescription medication in the first year (RR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.2). Urinary arsenic was related specifically to respiratory symptoms (difficulty breathing, wheezing and cough) lasting {\textgreater}/= 2 days or requiring prescription medication (RR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.2; RR = 1.2; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.5, respectively), and wheezing lasting {\textgreater}/=2 days, resulting in a doctor visit or prescription medication treatment (RR = 1.3; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.7; RR = 1.3; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 1.8, and RR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 2.2).

CONCLUSIONS: In utero arsenic exposure was associated with a higher risk of infection during the first year of life in our study population, particularly infections requiring medical treatment, and with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms.},

We estimated the cancer risk of the participants from arsenic endemic regions of West Bengal, India. The probable cancer risk was estimated following the assessment of daily inorganic arsenic intake through drinking water and diets of 20 participants for three consecutive years who had been using low arsenic water in the Indian context (median arsenic concentration in the study Years-I, II and III were 22, 16, 13 µg/l respectively). Probable cancer risk of the population was 2.80 × 10 −4 , 2.94 × 10 −4 , 3.12 × 10 −4 in the three respective study years (Year-I, II and III); just higher than the US EPA risk level of concern. The arsenic species content of the paired raw, cooked rice and urine was estimated in the as is taken basis. The major diet component, rice contained 72--86{\%} inorganic arsenic whereas urine contains 70{\%} organic arsenic on an average. The cancer risk assessment has been proposed to be modified by inclusion of urine arsenic release, considering the fact of arsenic release through urine. The risk became 1.28 × 10 −5 , 1.13 × 10 −5 , 1.01 × 10 −5 in the study Year-I, II and III respectively, considering urinary arsenic release, attributed the consideration of urine arsenic release into probable cancer risk estimation.},

	abstract = {Background {\&} objectives: Health literacy on tuberculosis (TB) is an understanding about TB to perform activities with regard to prevention, diagnosis and treatment. We undertook a study to assess the health literacy on TB among one of the vulnerable tribal groups (Saharia) in central India. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 2721 individuals aged {\textgreater}15 yr from two districts of Madhya Pradesh state of India were interviewed at their residence during December 2012-July 2013. By using a short-form questionnaire, health literacy on cause, symptoms, mode of transmission, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB was assessed. Results: Of the 2721 (Gwalior 1381; shivpuri 1340) individuals interviewed; 76 per cent were aged {\textless}45 yr. Living condition was very poor (62{\%} living in huts/katcha houses, 84 per cent with single room, 89 per cent no separate kitchen, 97 per cent used wood/crop as a fuel). Overall literacy rate was 19 per cent, and 22 per cent had {\textgreater}7 members in a house. Of the 2721 respondents participated, 52 per cent had never heard of TB; among them 8 per cent mentioned cough as a symptom, 64 per cent mentioned coughing up blood, and 91 per cent knew that TB diagnosis, and treatment facilities were available in both government and private hospitals. Health literacy score among participants who had heard of TB was {\textless}40 per cent among 36 per cent of respondents, 41-60 per cent among 54 per cent and {\textgreater}60 per cent among 8 per cent of respondents. Interpretation {\&} conclusions: The finding that nearly half of the respondents had not heard of TB indicated an important gap in education regarding TB in this vulnerable population. There is an urgent need to implement targeted interventions to educate this group for better TB control. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to conduct a survey of arsenic (As) content in rice cereals for infants. The analysis was based on the FDA Elemental Analysis Manual (EAM 4.11). An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to determine total As. Due to the different toxicities of the chemical forms of arsenic, the ICP-MS coupled to a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) was used to perform As speciation. The total and speciated arsenic was determined in 31 different infant rice cereals sold in U.S. supermarkets. The mass fraction of total inorganic As (iAs; sum of arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V)) concentrations ranged between 55.5 $\pm$ 1.3 and 158.0 $\pm$ 6.0 $\mu$g/kg. The average total arsenic and iAs concentrations in infant rice cereal were 174.4 and 101.4 $\mu$g/kg, respectively. There was no substantial difference in iAs levels between organic and conventional rice cereals. The mixed-grain rice cereal contained the least total (105 $\mu$g/kg) and inorganic arsenic (63 $\mu$g/kg). The major detected organoarsenical species was dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) was not detected, or only trace levels were found. Spiked sample percent recoveries for iAs, DMA, and MMA ranged from a low of 97.3{\%} for iAs to a high of 115.0{\%} for DMA. Results for speciated and total As in the National Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference material rice flour (NIST SRM 1568) were in good agreement with certified values. In the NIST SRM 1568 sample (n = 5) repeatability ({\%}RSD) was 2.8{\%} for iAs, 1.7{\%} for DMA and species sum, and 5.3{\%} for the total arsenic by As total method. The average percent mass balance was 99.9 $\pm$ 6.3{\%} for the NIST SRM 1568 sample. This study provides new and much needed information on arsenic levels in rice-based infant cereals.},

	abstract = {Early-life exposure to arsenic increases risk of developing a variety of non-malignant and malignant diseases. Arsenic-induced carcinogenesis may be mediated through epigenetic mechanisms and pathways leading to inflammation. Our previous study reported that prenatal arsenic exposure leads to increased mRNA expression of several genes related to inflammation, including COX2, EGR1, and SOCS3. This study aimed to investigate the effects of arsenic exposure on promoter DNA methylation and mRNA expression of these inflammatory genes (COX2, EGR1, and SOCS3), as well as the generation of 8-nitroguanine, which is a mutagenic DNA lesion involved in inflammation-related carcinogenesis. Prenatally arsenic-exposed newborns had promoter hypomethylation of COX2, EGR1, and SOCS3 in cord blood lymphocytes (p {\textless} 0.01). A follow-up study in these prenatally arsenic-exposed children showed a significant hypomethylation of these genes in salivary DNA (p {\textless} 0.01). In vitro experiments confirmed that arsenite treatment at short-term high doses (10--100 $\mu$M) and long-term low doses (0.5--1 $\mu$M) in human lymphoblasts (RPMI 1788) caused promoter hypomethylation of these genes, which was in concordance with an increase in their mRNA expression. Additionally, the level of urinary 8-nitroguanine was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.01) in exposed newborns and children, by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. Arsenic accumulation in toenails was negatively correlated with hypomethylation of these genes and positively correlated with levels of 8-nitroguanine. These results indicated that early-life exposure to arsenic causes hypomethylation of COX2, EGR1, and SOCS3, increases mRNA expression of these genes, and increases 8-nitroguanine formation. These effects may be linked to mechanisms of arsenic-induced inflammation and cancer development later in life.},

@article{Parajuli2015,
	abstract = {Background: Inconsistent results continue to be reported from studies linking low-level prenatal lead exposure and child development. Because of limited earlier epidemiological studies with birth cohort follow up design, it still remains inconclusive that either the associations of cord blood level of toxic, and essential elements, and postnatal raising environment on neurodevelopment of children remains constant throughout childhood or change over time. Aims: This study aims to investigate the influence of in utero toxic [lead (Pb) and arsenic (As)] and essential elements [zinc (Zn)] levels on neurodevelopment of 36 months children in Chitwan valley, Nepal taking the postnatal environment into account. Study Designs and Subjects: In this birth cohort study, participants (N=100 mother-infants' pairs) were recruited in Chitwan district, Nepal. We measured Pb, As and Zn concentrations in cord blood. Postnatal raising environment (i.e., Home score or home environment hereafter) was evaluated using Home Observation for Measurement of Environment (HOME) scale. Neurodevelopment of children at 36 months of age (n=70) were assessed using Bayley Scale of Infant Development, Second Edition (BSID II). Multivariate regression was performed (n=70) to see the association of in utero toxic and essential elements level and home environment with neurodevelopment score adjusted for covariates. Results: Cord blood levels of Pb, As and Zn were not associated with any BSID II cluster scores of 36 months children. The children with relatively superior HOME score and concurrent nutritional status (weight at 36 months) showed better cognitive development (i.e., MDI scores) and motor functions than their counterparts, respectively. Conclusion: In this general population in Nepal, prenatal Pb, As and Zn levels are not important determinants of the neurodevelopment of 36-month-old children while a consistent beneficial effect of a stimulating home environment on neurodevelopmental indicators is continued.},

@article{EFSA2010,
	abstract = {Lead occurs primarily in the inorganic form in the environment. Human exposure is mainly via food and water, with some via air, dust and soil. In average adult consumers, lead dietary exposure ranges from 0.36 to 1.24, up to 2.43 µg/kg body weight (b.w.) per day in high consumers in Europe. Exposure of infants ranges from 0.21 to 0.94 µg/kg b.w. per day and in children from 0.80 to 3.10 (average consumers), up to 5.51 (high consumers) µg/kg b.w. per day. Cereal products contribute most to dietary lead exposure, while dust and soil can be important non-dietary sources in children. Lead is absorbed more in children than in adults and accumulates in soft tissues and, over time, in bones. Half-lives of lead in blood and bone are approximately 30 days and 10 30 years, respectively, and excretion is primarily in urine and faeces. The Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) identified developmental neurotoxicity in young children and cardiovascular effects and nephrotoxicity in adults as the critical effects for the risk assessment. The respective BMDLs derived from blood lead levels in µg/L (corresponding dietary intake values in µg/kg b.w. per day) were: developmental neurotoxicity BMDL01, 12 (0.50); effects on systolic blood pressure BMDL01, 36 (1.50); effects on prevalence of chronic kidney disease BMDL10, 15 (0.63). The CONTAM Panel concluded that the current PTWI of 25 $\mu$g/kg b.w. is no longer appropriate as there is no evidence for a threshold for critical lead-induced effects. In adults, children and infants the margins of exposures were such that the possibility of an effect from lead in some consumers, particularly in children from 1--7 years of age, cannot be excluded. Protection of children against the potential risk of neurodevelopmental effects would be protective for all other adverse effects of lead, in all populations.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary function tests have rarely been assessed in preschool children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The objective of this multicenter study was to compare pulmonary function in 39 preschool children with CF (height, 90-130 cm; 16 homozygous $\Delta$F508) and in 79 healthy control children. Functional residual capacity (helium dilution technique) and expiratory interrupter resistance (Rint exp) (interrupter technique) were measured. As compared with control children, children with CF had significantly higher Rint exp, expressed as absolute values and as Z-scores (1.05 $\pm$ 0.36 versus 0.80 $\pm$ 0.20 kPa{\textperiodcentered}L -1{\textperiodcentered}second, p {\textless} 0.0001; and 1.31 $\pm$ 1.72 versus 0.19 $\pm$ 0.97, p {\textless} 0.0001), and significantly lower specific expiratory interrupter conductance (1.29 $\pm$ 0.34 versus 1.63 $\pm$ 0.43 kPa -1{\textperiodcentered}second, p {\textless} 0.0001). The effect of the bronchodilator salbutamol on Rint exp was not significantly different between children with CF and control children. Rint exp Z-scores were significantly higher in children with CF who were exposed to passive smoke (n = 8) (p {\textless} 0.03). Children with CF and with a history of respiratory symptoms (n = 31) had significantly higher functional residual capacity Z-scores (p {\textless} 0.02) and lower specific expiratory interrupter conductance Z-scores (p {\textless} 0.04). Genotype did not influence the data. We conclude that Rint exp and functional residual capacity measurements may help to follow young children with CF who are unable to perform reproducible forced expiratory maneuvers.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to arsenic (As) risk assessment using biomonitoring. In this pilot study we determined the levels of total and speciated urinary arsenicin 109 Spanish school children aged between 6 and 11 years, and interpreted these concentrations in a risk assessment context. The geometric mean (GM) for total As (TAs) was 33.82 $\mu$/L. The order of occurrence and average concentrations of the different species was arsenobetaine (AsB) (100{\%}, 15 $\mu$g/L), dimethylarsinic (DMA) (97{\%}, 8.32 $\mu$g/L), monomethylarsonic (MMA) (26{\%}, 0.27 $\mu$g/L) and inorganic As (iAs) (4{\%}, 0.14 $\mu$g/L). 18{\%} of children presented exposures to inorganic arsenic (7.52 $\mu$g/g creatinine) higher than guidance value for non-cancer risk (8.3 $\mu$g/g creatinine). For cancer risk the exposure to inorganic arsenic was much higher than the guidance value. Urinary DMA was positively associated with urinary AsB, suggesting exposure directly to this specie or metabolism of organic arsenicals to this specie, mainly through seafood consumption. Consequently, the exposure to inorganic As needs to be carefully interpreted because it may be overestimated. Our study supports the hypothesis that urinary iAs + MMA is the most reliable biomarker of exposure to inorganic As.},

	abstract = {Ingested arsenic is known to be not only excreted by urine, but to be stored in sulphydryl-rich tissue like hair, nail or skin. We developed an extraction method for arsenic species from these tissues and studied the stability of different arsenic species during the extraction process. Inorganic and pentavalent methylated arsenic was found to be stable under the extraction conditions, whereas trivalent methylated arsenicals and the thio-analogue of DMA(V) stop (DMAS) showed reduced stability. The absorption ability of hair for these different species was studied as well. Inorganic arsenic is better absorbed by hair than monomethyl- or dimethyl-arsenicals, whereby the trivalent forms are taken up better than the pentavalent forms. Independent of which methylated arsenical was used for the incubation, the pentavalent form was always the dominant form after extraction. Hair and nail samples from humans suffering from chronic arsenic intoxication contained dominantly inorganic arsenic with small and strongly varying amounts of DMA(V) stop and MA(V) stop present. DMAS was only found in some nail sample extracts containing unusually high amounts of DMA(V) stop and is believed to be formed during the extraction process.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) are elements arousing major public health concerns associated with environmental pollution, high toxicity potential, and carcinogenic nature. However, selenium (Se) at low doses and incorporated into enzymes and proteins has antioxidant properties and protects animals and humans from the risk of various diseases. It also has an exceptionally narrow range between necessary and toxic concentrations, which is a well-known hindrance in its use as a dietary supplement. The present article aims to update and expand the role of Se in As and Cd toxicity discussed in our earlier paper. In general, recent reports show that Se, regardless of its form (as selenite, selenomethionine, nanoSe, or Se from lentils), can reduce As- or Cd-mediated toxicity in the liver, kidney, spleen, brain, or heart in animal models and in cell culture studies. As was suggested in our earlier review, Se antagonizes the toxicity of As and Cd mainly through sequestration of these elements into biologically inert complexes and/or through the action of Se-dependent antioxidant enzymes. An increase in the As methylation efficiency is proposed as a possible mechanism by which Se can reduce As toxicity. However, new studies indicate that Se may also diminish As or Cd toxicity by activation of the Nrf2 pathway. In addition, this paper discusses possible signs of Se toxic effects, which may be a challenge for its future use in the therapy of As and Cd poisoning and provide future directions to address this issue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from an observational study involving neonates suggested that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as compared with conventional ventilation, was associated with superior small-airway function at follow-up. Data from randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding. METHODS: We studied 319 adolescents who had been born before 29 weeks of gestation and had been enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial that compared HFOV with conventional ventilation immediately after birth. The trial involved 797 neonates, of whom 592 survived to hospital discharge. We compared follow-up data from adolescents who had been randomly assigned to HFOV with follow-up data from those who had been randomly assigned to conventional ventilation, with respect to lung function and respiratory health, health-related quality of life, and functional status, as assessed with the use of questionnaires completed when the participants were 11 to 14 years of age. The primary outcome was forced expiratory flow at 75{\%} of the expired vital capacity (FEF75). RESULTS: The HFOV group had superior results on a test of small-airway function (z score for FEF75, -0.97 with HFOV vs. -1.19 with conventional therapy; adjusted difference, 0.23 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.45]). There were significant differences in favor of HFOV in several other measures of respiratory function, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow, diffusing capacity, and impulse-oscillometric findings. As compared with the conventional-therapy group, the HFOV group had significantly higher ratings from teachers in three of eight school subjects assessed, but there were no other significant differences in functional outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial involving children who had been born extremely prematurely, those who had undergone HFOV, as compared with those who had received conventional ventilation, had superior lung function at 11 to 14 years of age, with no evidence of poorer functional outcomes.

We measured total As concentrations in hair and nails, and concentrations of the different species of As and its metabolites as well as 8-OHdG in urine of 110 non-smoking adults living in a rural region of the Province of Quebec, Canada. Significant differences in exposure biomarker levels were observed between individuals consuming drinking water with As levels of{\textless}/=1.0,{\textgreater}1.0 -{\textless}/=10 and{\textgreater}10 mug/l. Multivariate linear regression analysis also showed a significant relationship between estimated daily drinking water intakes of As and biomarker levels. Conversely, 8-OHdG levels were not significantly related to daily drinking water intakes of As or to hair, nail or urinary exposure biomarker levels, according to multivariate linear regression analysis. Even at the relatively low levels of As found in well water of our participants, water consumption significantly increases their body load of As, as confirmed by multiple matrix measurements, which reflected exposure over different time frames. However, this increased internal As dose was not associated with higher oxidative damage to DNA as reflected by urinary 8-OHdG levels.},

In order to determine and assess the use of arsenic contents in different biological samples as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater in Cambodia, individual scalp hair, fingernail and toenail were collected from three different provinces in the Mekong River basin of Cambodia. After washing and acid-digestion, digestate was analyzed for total arsenic by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Chemical analysis of the acid-digested hair revealed that among 270 hair samples cut from Kandal, 78.1{\%} had arsenic content in scalp hair (Ash) greater than the typical Ash(1.00$\mu$gg-1), indicating possible arsenic toxicity. Concurrently, 1.2{\%} and 0.6{\%} were found elevated in Kratie (n=84) and Kampong Cham (n=173), respectively. Similarly, the upper end of the ranges for arsenic contents in fingernail (Asfn) and toenail (Astn) clipped from Kandal (fingernail n=241; toenail n=187) were higher than the normal arsenic content in nail (0.43-1.08$\mu$gg-1), however, none was observed elevated in both Kratie (fingernail n=76, toenail n=42) and Kampong Cham (fingernail n=83; toenail n=52). Significant positive intercorrelations between groundwater arsenic concentration (Asw), average daily dose (ADD) of arsenic, Ash, Asfnand Astnsuggest that Ash, Asfnand Astncan be used as biomarkers of chronic arsenic exposure from drinking arsenic-rich groundwater, in which Ashis more favorable than Asfnand Astndue to the ease of sample processing and analytical measurements, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

In this patient population, there are unique aspects of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and management of CD. In terms of management, early and timely recognition of CD can maximize childhood and adolescent development and prevent complications. This requires insight into the unique presentations of CD in the pediatric population. Furthermore, health care providers must use proper screening methods and continue surveillance of at-risk individuals throughout childhood. Potential interventions for primary prevention of CD in children, although not completely understood, may offer some benefit.

The analytical data collected throughout a hydrologic period can be used for hydrological modelling and also to select appropriate preventive and/or corrective measures in order to avoid pollution of watercourses. Caudal River drains the main abandoned Hg mine sites (located in Mieres and Pola de Lena districts) in Central Asturias (NW Spain). This paper describes a systematic monitoring of physical and chemical parameters in eighteen selected sampling points within the Caudal River catchment. At each sampling station, water flow, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, redox potential and turbidity were controlled "in situ" and major and trace elements were analysed in the laboratory. In the Hg-mineralised areas, As is present in the form of As-rich pyrite, realgar and occasionally arsenopyrite. Mine drainage and leachates from spoil heaps exhibit in some cases acidic conditions and high As contents, and they are incorporated to Caudal River tributaries. Multivariate statistical analysis aids to the interpretation of the spatial and temporary variations found in the sampled areas, as part of a methodology applicable to different environmental and geological studies. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In global terms, respiratory viral infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Infancy, in particular, is a time of increased disease susceptibility and severity. Early-life viral infection causes acute illness and can be associated with the development of wheezing and asthma in later life. The most commonly detected viruses are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and influenza virus. In this review we explore the complete picture from epidemiology and virology to clinical impact and immunology. Three striking aspects emerge. The first is the degree of similarity: although the infecting viruses are all different, the clinical outcome, viral evasion strategies, immune response, and long-term sequelae share many common features. The second is the interplay between the infant immune system and viral infection: the immaturity of the infant immune system alters the outcome of viral infection, but at the same time, viral infection shapes the development of the infant immune system and its future responses. Finally, both the virus and the immune response contribute to damage to the lungs and subsequent disease, and therefore, any prevention or treatment needs to address both of these factors.},

Objective: We evaluated the association between levels of methylation in leukocyte DNA at long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and genetic and non-genetic characteristics of 892 control participants from the Spanish Bladder Cancer/EPICURO study. Methods: We determined LINE-1 methylation levels by pyrosequencing. Individual data included demographics, smoking status, nutrient intake, toenail concentrations of 12 trace elements, xenobiotic metabolism gene variants, and 515 polymorphisms among 24 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway. To assess the association between LINE-1 methylation levels (percentage of methylated cytosines) and potential determinants, we estimated beta coefficients ($\beta$s) by robust linear regression. Results: Women had lower levels of LINE-1 methylation than men ($\beta$ = -0.7, p = 0.02). Persons who smoked blond tobacco showed lower methylation than nonsmokers ($\beta$ = -0.7, p = 0.03). Arsenic toenail concentration was inversely associated with LINE-1 methylation ($\beta$ = -3.6, p = 0.003). By contrast, iron ($\beta$ = 0.002, p = 0.009) and nickel ($\beta$ = 0.02, p = 0.004) were positively associated with LINE-1 methylation.

	abstract = {Adaptation drives genomic changes; however, evidence of specific adaptations in humans remains limited. We found that inhabitants of the northern Argentinean Andes, an arid region where elevated arsenic concentrations in available drinking water is common, have unique arsenic metabolism, with efficient methylation and excretion of the major metabolite dimethylated arsenic and a less excretion of the highly toxic monomethylated metabolite. We genotyped women from this population for 4,301,332 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found a strong association between the AS3MT (arsenic [+3 oxidation state] methyltransferase) gene and mono- and dimethylated arsenic in urine, suggesting that AS3MT functions as the major gene for arsenic metabolism in humans. We found strong genetic differentiation around AS3MT in the Argentinean Andes population, compared with a highly related Peruvian population (FST = 0.014) from a region with much less environmental arsenic. Also, 13 of the 100 SNPs with the highest genome-wide Locus-Specific Branch Length occurred near AS3MT. In addition, our examination of extended haplotype homozygosity indicated a selective sweep of the Argentinean Andes population, in contrast to Peruvian and Colombian populations. Our data show that adaptation to tolerate the environmental stressor arsenic has likely driven an increase in the frequencies of protective variants of AS3MT, providing the first evidence of human adaptation to a toxic chemical.},

	abstract = {Background There is growing concern that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, which are widely used in consumer products, might affect susceptibility to infections and the development of allergy and asthma in children, but there are currently very few prospective studies. Objective We sought to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to BPA and phthalates increases the risk of respiratory and allergic outcomes in children at various ages from birth to 7 years. Methods We measured BPA and metabolites of high-molecular-weight phthalates, 4 di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites ($\Sigma$4DEHP) and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and 3 low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) metabolites ($\Sigma$3LMWP) in urine samples collected during the first and third trimesters in pregnant women participating in the Infancia y Medio Ambiente-Sabadell birth cohort study. The occurrence of chest infections, bronchitis, wheeze, and eczema in children was assessed at ages 6 and 14 months and 4 and 7 years through questionnaires given to the mothers. Atopy (specific IgE measurement) and asthma (questionnaire) were assessed at ages 4 and 7 years, respectively. Results The relative risks (RRs) of wheeze (RR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.40; P =.02), chest infections (RR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.32; P =.05), and bronchitis (RR, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.37; P =.04) at any age increased for each doubling in concentration of maternal urinary BPA. $\Sigma$4DEHP metabolites were associated with the same outcomes (wheeze: RR, 1.25; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-1.50, P =.02; chest infections: RR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.35; P =.11; bronchitis: RR, 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.43; P =.04). MBzP was associated with higher risk of wheeze (RR, 1.15; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.33; P =.05). The risk of asthma at age 7 years was also increased with increasing prenatal BPA, $\Sigma$4DEHP, and MBzP exposure. There were no other exposure-outcome associations. Conclusions Prenatal exposure to BPA and high-molecular-weight phthalates might increase the risk of asthma symptoms and respiratory tract infections throughout childhood.},

Logistic regression models were used to estimate prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between rice intake and prevalent skin lesions at baseline. Discrete time hazard models were used to estimate discrete time (HRs) ratios and their 95{\%} CIs for the associations between rice intake and incident skin lesions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Steamed rice consumption was positively associated with creatinine-adjusted urinary total arsenic ($\beta$=0.041, 95{\%} CI: 0.032-0.051) and urinary total arsenic with statistical adjustment for creatinine in the model ($\beta$=0.043, 95{\%} CI: 0.032-0.053). Additionally, we observed a significant trend in skin lesion prevalence (P-trend=0.007) and a moderate trend in skin lesion incidence (P-trend=0.07) associated with increased intake of steamed rice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that rice intake may be a source of arsenic exposure beyond drinking water.},

BMI showed significant inverse associations with toenail arsenic (p=0.01), which persisted in models adjusted for demographics, diet and work history.

	abstract = {Arsenic is a human bladder carcinogen. Arsenic is methylated to both monomethyl and dimethyl metabolites which have been detected in human urine. The trivalent methylated arsenicals are more toxic than inorganic arsenic. It is unknown if these trivalent methylated metabolites can directly cause malignant transformation in human cells. The goal of this study is determine if monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) can induce malignant transformation in a human bladder urothelial cell line. To address this goal, a non-tumorigenic human urothelial cell line (UROtsa) was continuously exposed to 0.05????M MMAIII for 52??weeks. Hyperproliferation was the first phenotypic change observed in exposed UROtsa (URO-MSC). After 12??weeks of exposure, doubling time had decreased from 42??h in unexposed control cells to 27??h in URO-MSC. Hyperproliferation continued to be a quality possessed by the URO-MSC cells after both 24 and 52??weeks of exposure to MMAIII, which had a 40-50{\%} reduction in doubling time. Throughout the 52-week exposure, URO-MSC cells retained an epithelial morphology with subtle morphological differences from control cells. 24??weeks of MMAIII exposure was required to induce anchorage-independent growth as detected by colony formation in soft agar, a characteristic not found in UROtsa cells. To further substantiate that malignant transformation had occurred, URO-MSC cells were tested after 24 and 52??weeks of exposure to MMAIII for the ability to form tumors in SCID mice. Enhanced tumorigenicity in SCID mouse xenografts was observed after 52??weeks of treatment with MMAIII. These observations are the first demonstration of MMAIII-induced malignant transformation in a human bladder urothelial cell line and provide important evidence that MMAIII may be carcinogenic in human tissues. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying windows of vulnerability to environmental toxicants is an important area in children's health research. OBJECTIVE: We compared and contrasted statistical approaches that may help identify windows of vulnerability by formally testing differences in exposure effects across time of exposure, incorporating continuous time metrics for timing of exposure, and efficiently incorporating incomplete cases. METHODS: We considered four methods: 1) window-specific and simultaneously adjusted regression; 2) multiple informant models; 3) using features of individual exposure patterns to predict outcomes; and 4) models of population exposure patterns depending on the outcome. We illustrate them using a study of prenatal vulnerability to lead in relation to Bayley's Mental Development Index at 24 months of age (MDI24). RESULTS: The estimated change in MDI24 score with a 1-loge-unit increase in blood lead during the first trimester was -2.74 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), -5.78 to 0.29] based on a window-specific regression. The corresponding change in MDI24 was -4.13 (95{\%} CI, -7.54 to -0.72) based on a multiple informant model; estimated effects were similar across trimesters (p = 0.23). Results from method 3 suggested that blood lead levels in early pregnancy were significantly associated with reduced MDI24, but decreasing blood leads over the course of pregnancy were not. Method 4 results indicated that blood lead levels before 17 weeks of gestation were lower among children with MDI24 scores in the 90th versus the 10th percentile (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Method 2 is preferred over method 1 because it enables formal testing of differences in effects across a priori-defined windows (e.g., trimesters of pregnancy). Methods 3 and 4 are preferred over method 2 when there is large variability in the timing of exposure assessments among participants. Methods 3 and 4 yielded smaller p-values for tests of the hypothesis that not only level but also timing of lead exposure are relevant predictors of MDI24; systematic power comparisons are warranted.},

Although a significant number of epidemiological studies on the neurodevelopmental effects of metal exposure has been published in the last twenty years, not many of them have considered the possible gender-specific effects of such exposure. This review is focused on studies where the gender differences in pre- and/or postnatal exposure/s to five metals (mercury, lead, manganese, cadmium, and arsenic) and neurodevelopment were evaluated.We conducted a PubMed search in December 2012 and retrieved 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria. A large body of literature on potential neurodevelopment effects in children due to mercury exposure is available, but, a clear pattern regarding gender differences in neurotoxicity is not elucidated. There is also abundant available information on the gender-specific health effects of lead, and exposure to this metal seems to affect boys more than girls. Information regarding gender differences in susceptibility of manganese, cadmium, and arsenic is still too scarce to draw any definite conclusion.More research is highly warranted about this matter. Environmental epidemiological studies should be designed to quantify differential gender-based exposures and outcomes, and this may provide new insights into prevention strategies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic-contaminated drinking water, and ingestion of inorganic arsenic (InAs) has been associated with increased risks of cancer. The primary metabolic pathway of ingested InAs is methylation to monomethyl arsenic (MMA) and dimethyl arsenic (DMA). However, people vary greatly in the degree to which they methylate InAs, and recent evidence suggests that those who excrete high proportions of ingested arsenic as MMA are more susceptible than others to arsenic-caused cancer. To date, little is known about the factors that determine interindividual differences in arsenic methylation. In this study, we assessed the effect of diet on arsenic metabolism by measuring dietary intakes and urinary arsenic methylation patterns in 87 subjects from two arsenic-exposed regions in the western United States. Subjects in the lower quartile of protein intake excreted a higher proportion of ingested InAs as MMA (14.6 vs. 11.6{\%}; p = 0.01) and a lower proportion as DMA (72.3 vs. 77.0{\%}; p = 0.01) than did subjects in the upper quartile of protein intake. Subjects in the lower quartile of iron, zinc, and niacin intake also had higher urinary percent MMA and lower percent DMA levels than did subjects with higher intakes of these nutrients. These associations were also seen in multivariate regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and total urinary arsenic. Given the previously reported links between high percent MMA and increased cancer risks, these findings are consistent with the theory that people with diets deficient in protein and other nutrients are more susceptible than others to arsenic-caused cancer.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author.The sum of urinary inorganic arsenic (iAs) and methylated arsenic (monomethylarsonate and dimethylarsinate (DMA)) species is the main biomarker of iAs exposure. Assessing iAs exposure, however, is difficult in populations with moderate-to-high seafood intakes. In the present study, we used subsamples from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (2000-2002) (n = 310) and the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 1,175). We calibrated urinary concentrations of non-seafood-derived iAs, DMA, and methylarsonate, as well as the sum of inorganic and methylated arsenic species, in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and of DMA in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey by regressing their original concentrations by arsenobetaine and extracting model residuals. To confirm that calibrated biomarkers reflected iAs exposure but not seafood intake, we compared urinary arsenic concentrations by levels of seafood and rice intakes. Self-reported seafood intakes, estimated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels, and measured n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels were positively associated with the original urinary arsenic biomarkers. Using the calibrated arsenic biomarkers, we found a marked attenuation of the associations with self-reported seafood intake and estimated or measured n-3 fatty acids, whereas associations with self-reported rice intake remained similar. Our residual-based method provides estimates of iAs exposure and metabolism for each participant that no longer reflect seafood intake and can facilitate research about low-to-moderate levels of iAs exposure in populations with high seafood intakes.},

@article{Cohen2016,
	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic induces a variety of toxicities including cancer. The mode of action for cancer and non-cancer effects involves the metabolic generation of trivalent arsenicals and their reaction with sulfhydryl groups within critical proteins in various cell types which leads to the biological response. In epithelial cells, the response is cell death with consequent regenerative proliferation. If this continues for a long period of time, it can result in an increased risk of cancer. Arsenicals do not react with DNA. There is evidence for indirect genotoxicity in various in vitro and in vivo systems, but these involve exposures at cytotoxic concentrations and are not the basis for cancer development. The resulting markers of genotoxicity could readily be due to the cytotoxicity rather than an effect on the DNA itself. Evidence for genotoxicity in humans has involved detection of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes and micronucleus formation in lymphocytes, buccal mucosal cells, and exfoliated urothelial cells in the urine. Numerous difficulties have been identified in the interpretation of such results, including inadequate assessment of exposure to arsenic, measurement of micronuclei, and potential confounding factors such as tobacco exposure, folate deficiency, and others. Overall, the data strongly supports a non-linear dose response for the effects of inorganic arsenic. In various in vitro and in vivo models and in human epidemiology studies there appears to be a threshold for biological responses, including cancer.},

	abstract = {Rice is more elevated in arsenic than all other grain crops tested to date, with whole grain (brown) rice having higher arsenic levels than polished (white). It is reported here that rice bran, both commercially purchased and specifically milled for this study, have levels of inorganic arsenic, a nonthreshold, class 1 carcinogen, reaching concentrations of approximately 1 mg/kg dry weight, around 10-20 fold higher than concentrations found in bulk grain. Although pure rice bran is used as a health food supplement, perhaps of more concern is rice bran solubles, which are marketed as a superfood and as a supplement to malnourished children in international aid programs. Five rice bran solubles products were tested, sourced from the United States and Japan, and were found to have 0.61-1.9 mg/kg inorganic arsenic. Manufactures recommend approximately 20 g servings of the rice bran solubles per day, which equates to a 0.012-0.038 mg intake of inorganic arsenic. There are no maximum concentration levels (MCLs) set for arsenic or its species in food stuffs. EU and U.S. water regulations, set at 0.01 mg/L total or inorganic arsenic, respectively, are based on the assumption that 1 L of water per day is consumed, i.e., 0.01 mg of arsenic/ day. At the manufacturers recommended rice bran solubles consumption rate, inorganic arsenic intake exceeds 0.01 mg/ day, remembering that rice bran solubles are targeted at malnourished children and that actual risk is based on mg kg(-1) day(-1) intake.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a ubiquitous element. The current WHO guideline for As in drinking water is 10. ??g/L. Furthermore, about 130 million people have only access to drinking water containing more than 10. gAs/L. Although numerous studies have shown the related adverse effects of As, sensitive appropriate biomarkers are still required for studies of environmental epidemiology. A review of the literature has shown that various biomarkers are used for such research. Their limits and advantages are highlighted in this paper: (i) the detection of As or its derivatives in the blood is an indication of the dose ingested but it is not evidence of chronic intoxication. (ii) The detection of As in urine is an indispensible procedure because it is a good marker for internal dose. It has been demonstrated to correlate well for a number of chronic effects related to As levels in drinking water. However confounding factors must be taken into account to avoid misinterpretation and this may require As speciation. (iii) As in the hair and nails reflects the level of long term exposure but it is difficult to relate the level with the dose ingested. (iv) Some studies showed a correlation between urinary As and urinary and blood porphyrins. However, it is difficult to use only porphyrins as a biomarker in a population survey carried out without doing further studies. (v) Genotoxic effects are based on the characterization of these potential effects. Most studies have detected increases in DNA damage, sister chromatid exchange, micronuclei or chromosomal aberrations in populations exposed to As in drinking water. Micronuclei assay is the technique of choice to follow these populations, because it is sensitive and easy to use.To conclude, whatever epidemiological studies are, the urinary and toenail biomarkers are useful to provide indications of internal dose. Moreover, micronuclei assay can be complementary use as biomarker of early effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rice consumption is one of the major pathways for As intake in populations that depend on a rice diet in several countries of South and South-east Asia. Pot experiments were undertaken to investigate the effects of water management (WM), arsenic (As) contaminated soil-water and Phosphorus (P) rates on As uptake in rice plants. There were 18 treatments comprising of three each of As rates (0, 20 and 40mgkg -1 soil) and P rates (0, 12.5 and 25mgkg -1 soil) and two WM (aerobic and anaerobic) strategies on winter (boro var. BRRI dhan 29) and monsoon (aman var. BRRI dhan 32) rice at the Wheat Research Center (WRC), Nashipur, Dinajpur, Bangladesh. Arsenic concentrations in rice grain and straw increased significantly ( **P???0.01) with the increasing As rates in the soil. Arsenic availability in soil pore-water solution was less (58{\%}) under aerobic WM (redox potential-Eh=+135 to +138mV; pH-6.50 at 24.3??C) as compared to anaerobic WM (flooded: Eh=-41 to -76mV; pH-6.43 at 23??C). The highest total grain As content 2.23??0.12mgkg -1 and 0.623??0.006mgkg -1 was found in T 6 (P 12.5As 40-anaerobic) and T 9 (P 25As 40-anaerobic) in BRRI dhan 29 and BRRI dhan 32, respectively, which was significantly higher (41-45{\%}) than in the same As and P treatments for pots under aerobic WM. The As content in rice straw (up to 24.7??0.49ppm in BRRI dhan 29, 17.3??0.49mgkg -1 in BRRI dhan 32 with the highest As level) suggested that As can more easily be translocated to the shoots under anaerobic conditions than aerobic condition. BRRI dhan 29 was more sensitive to As than BRRI dhan 32. Under aerobic WM, P soil amendments reduced As uptake by rice plants. The study demonstrated that aerobic water management along with optimum P amendment and selection of arsenic inefficient rice varieties are appropriate options that can be applied to minimize As accumulation in rice which can reduce effects on human and cattle health risk as well as soil contamination. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are exposed to arsenic via contaminated water. The goal of this study was to identify whether arsenic-associated lung function deficits resemble obstructive- or restrictive-like lung disease, in order to help illuminate a mechanistic pathway and identify at-risk populations. Recent Findings: We recently published a qualitative systematic review outlining the body of research on arsenic and non-malignant respiratory outcomes. Evidence from several populations, at different life stages, and at different levels of exposure showed consistent associations of arsenic exposure with chronic lung disease mortality, respiratory symptoms, and lower lung function levels. The published review, however, only conducted a broad qualitative description of the published studies without considering specific spirometry patterns, without conducting a meta-analysis, and without evaluating the dose-response relationship. Summary: We searched PubMed and Embase for studies on environmental arsenic exposure and lung function. We performed a meta-analysis using inverse-variance-weighted random effects models to summarize adjusted effect estimates for arsenic and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC ratio. Across nine studies, median water arsenic levels ranged from 23 to 860 $\mu$g/L. The pooled estimated mean difference (MD) comparing the highest category of arsenic exposure (ranging from {\textgreater} 11 to {\textgreater} 800 $\mu$g/L) versus the lowest (ranging from {\textless} 10 to {\textless} 100 $\mu$g/L) for each study for FEV1 was -- 42 mL (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) − 70, − 16) and for FVC was -- 50 mL (95{\%} CI − 63, − 37). Three studies reported effect estimates for FEV1/FVC, for which there was no evidence of an association; the pooled estimated MD was 0.01 (95{\%} CI − 0.005, 0.024). This review supports that arsenic is associated with restrictive impairments based on inverse associations between arsenic and FEV1 and FVC, but not with FEV1/FVC. Future studies should confirm whether low-level arsenic exposure is a restrictive lung disease risk factor in order to identify at-risk populations in the USA.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature America, Inc. Manganese (Mn) is an essential nutrient; however, overexposure can be neurotoxic. Recent evidence suggests that exposure to Mn from drinking water could be neurotoxic; however, research is hampered by the lack of consensus on a reliable biomarker of Mn exposure. Naturally high concentrations of Mn can occur in groundwater, particularly for private, unregulated water systems. This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to Mn from drinking water with a relatively low Mn content (median of 2.9 $\mu$g/L; range, undetectable--8,340 $\mu$g/L) and Mn in toenails from women collected at two time points: during and after pregnancy. Mn concentrations in the paired toenail samples gathered during the second to third trimester of pregnancy and 2 weeks postpartum were correlated (r = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 596). Among women consuming drinking water Mn in the highest tertile (i.e., {\textgreater} 9.8 $\mu$g/L) significant positive correlations were found between water Mn and toenails Mn (r = 0.31 and r = 0.38, for toenail samples collected during pregnancy and postpartum, respectively), whereas little to no correlation was observed at lower water concentrations. Overall, our data suggest that maternal toenail samples are a reliable environmental Mn exposure biomarker and reflect exposure from drinking water.},

@article{Hardy2017,
	abstract = {Following a request from the European Commission to EFSA, the EFSA Scientific Committee (SC) prepared a guidance for the risk assessment of substances present in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age. In its approach to develop this guidance, the EFSA SC took into account, among others, (i) an exposure assessment based on infant formula as the only source of nutrition; (ii) knowledge of organ development in human infants, including the development of the gut, metabolic and excretory capacities, the brain and brain barriers, the immune system, the endocrine and reproductive systems; (iii) the overall toxicological profile of the substance identified through the standard toxicological tests, including critical effects; (iv) the relevance for the human infant of the neonatal experimental animal models used. The EFSA SC notes that during the period from birth up to 16 weeks, infants are expected to be exclusively fed on breast milk and/or infant formula. The EFSA SC views this period as the time where health-based guidance values for the general population do not apply without further considerations. High infant formula consumption per body weight is derived from 95th percentile consumption. The first weeks of life is the time of the highest relative consumption on a body weight basis. Therefore, when performing an exposure assessment, the EFSA SC proposes to use the high consumption value of 260 mL/kg bw per day.

	abstract = {A large number of residents on the southwest coast of Taiwan suffer from an endemic peripheral vascular disease called blackfoot disease. Although the etiology has been investigated since 1958, the cause of blackfoot disease remains unknown. Certain substances contained in artesian well water have been implicated as causal factors, including arsenic as the predominant element. Data in this study demonstrated that in the well water collected from blackfoot disease regions of Taiwan there was a marked increase in total arsenic concentrations, with the predominant species being inorganic arsenical compounds. The concentrations of organic methyl arsenicals were present in minimal amounts. The excretion of total arsenic, inorganic arsenic, monomethylarsonic acid, and trimethylarsenic acid in the urine of patients afflicted with blackfoot disease was significantly higher than for control subjects. Further, in patients with blackfoot disease the concentrations of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic were markedly elevated in the hair and fingernails. Data suggest that blackfoot disease is associated with individuals ingesting well, water contaminated with arsenic primarily in the inorganic form and that hair, fingernails, or urine specimens serve as equally effective biomarkers of exposure. The fact that arsenic intoxication as manifested by blackfoot disease is still prevalent despite the stoppage of well-water consumption for two decades illustrates the persistent nature of arsenic action.},

	abstract = {A standard taxonomy and visualization methods can provide postdoctoral scholars with tools to critically evaluate their career prospects. P ostdoctoral scholars are highly skilled sci-entists that, classically, have been trained to enter into academic tenure-track positions. However, the number of these tenure-track positions is remaining largely flat while the number of postdoctoral fellows is increas-ing, meaning that the majority of scientists will obtain other types of careers. To make informed decisions about these careers, schol-ars need institution-level knowledge about their options. Institutions have been implored to collect and report this information for decades, but the lack of a standard career out-come taxonomy and visualization method has severely impeded progress. Here, we address these impediments by developing a three-tiered, hierarchical taxonomy and visualization methodology---creating standard definitions for: (i) job sectors (6); (ii) job types (7); and (iii) job specifics (20)---that will empower meaning-ful cross-institutional career outcome compari-sons on a global scale. Applying our methods to intramural NIEHS alumni (50/50 US versus international), we report the first account of detailed career outcomes for all postdoctoral scholars present at NIH/NIEHS within the past 15 years, which revealed striking differences among subpopulations. US scholars enter into the for-profit sector in professional job-types conducting applied research at a much higher rate than international scholars. International scholars enter the academic sector in tenure-track job-types conducting basic research at Figure 1 Visualizing alumni migration by pairing country/continent of origin with country/continent of job location.

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is an element that is nonessential for and toxic to plants. Arsenic contamination in the environment occurs in many regions, and, depending on environmental factors, its accumulation in food crops may pose a health risk to humans.Recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of As uptake and metabolism in plants is reviewed here. Arsenate is taken up by phosphate transporters. A number of the aquaporin nodulin26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) are able to transport arsenite,the predominant form of As in reducing environments. In rice (Oryza sativa), arsenite uptake shares the highly efficient silicon (Si) pathway of entry to root cells and efflux towards the xylem. In root cells arsenate is rapidly reduced to arsenite, which is effluxed to the external medium, complexed by thiol peptides or translocated to shoots. One type of arsenate reductase has been identified, but its in planta functions remain to be investigated. Some fern species in the Pteridaceae family are able to hyperaccumulate As in above-ground tissues. Hyperaccumulation appears to involve enhanced arsenate uptake, decreased arsenite-thiol complexation and arsenite efflux to the external medium, greatly enhanced xylem translocation of arsenite, and vacuolar sequestration of arsenite in fronds. Current knowledge gaps and future research directions are also identified.},

The heavy metals in water, recorded as follows: Fe {\textgreater} Mn {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Ni {\textgreater} Cr {\textgreater} Cd and all were found to be above the prescribed limits. According to metal pollution index, exposed muscle (49.86), kidney (47.68) and liver (45.26) have been recorded to have higher bioaccumulation. The blood biochemical analysis of exposed O. niloticus indicated significant increase in activities of aspartate aminotransferase (+ 343.5{\%}), alkaline phosphatase (+ 673.6{\%}), alanine aminotransferase (+ 309.1{\%}), and creatinine (+ 494.3{\%}) over the reference. However, a significant decrease in albumin (A): globulins (G) ratio (− 87.86{\%}) was observed. Similarly, the exposed fish also showed significant increase in total leucocyte count (+ 121{\%}), differential leucocyte count, respiratory burst (+ 1175{\%}), and nitric oxide synthase (+ 420{\%}). The histological examination of liver and kidney showed tissue injury. Moreover, micronuclei (0.95{\%}), kidney shaped nuclei (1.2{\%}), and lobed nuclei (0.6{\%}) along with DNA damage in the form of mean tail length in the liver (20.7 µm) and kidney (16.5 µm) was observed in the exposed O. niloticus. Potential health risk assessments based on estimated daily intake, target hazard quotient, hazard index, and target cancer risk indicated health risks associated with the consumption of these contaminated fishes. In conclusion, the present study showed that exposure to heavy metals contaminated water can alter immunological response; induce histopathological alterations and DNA damage in the studied fish. The consumption of this contaminated water or fish could have serious impact on human health.},

We examined metal exposures in young children (6-37. months) from Montevideo, Uruguay and their mothers (15-47. years) participating in a community-based study. Hair samples collected from 180 children and their mothers were analyzed for: lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), and arsenic (As) concentration using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Median metal levels ($\mu$g/g) were: Pb 13.69, Mn 1.45, Cd 0.17, and As 0.09 for children and Pb 4.27, Mn 1.42, Cd 0.08, and As 0.02 for mothers. Of the child and maternal samples, 1.7{\%} and 2.9{\%} were below the limit of detection (LOD) for Cd, and 21.3{\%} and 38.5{\%} were below the LOD for As, respectively. Correlations between maternal and child levels ranged 0.38-0.55 (p{\textless}0.01). Maternal hair metal levels were the strongest predictors of metal concentrations in children's hair. Girls had significantly lower As levels than boys (p{\textless}0.01) but did not differ on other metals. In addition, in bivariate logistic regressions predicting the likelihood that the child would be exposed to multiple metals, hemoglobin {\textless}10.5. g/dL (OR=2.12, p{\textless}0.05), blood lead (OR=1.17, p{\textless}0.01), and the mother being exposed to two or more metals (OR=3.34, p{\textless}0.01) were identified as significant predictors of increased likelihood of multiple metal exposure. Older child age (OR=0.96, p{\textless}0.05), higher maternal education (OR=0.35, p{\textless}0.01), and higher number of household possessions (OR=0.83, p{\textless}0.01) were significantly associated with decreased likelihood of multiple metal exposure. Preschool children in Uruguay are exposed to multiple metals at levels that in other studies have been associated with cognitive and behavioral deficits. Sources of exposure, as well as cognitive and behavioral consequences of multiple metal exposure, should be investigated in this population. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {An analytical method for the determination of inorganic arsenic in fish samples using HPLC-ICP-MS has been developed. The fresh homogenised sample was subjected to microwave-assisted dissolution by sodium hydroxide in ethanol, which dissolved the sample and quantitatively oxidised arsenite (As(III)) to arsenate (As(V)). This allowed for the determination of inorganic arsenic as a single species, i.e. As(V), by anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS. The completeness of the oxidation was verified by recovery of As(V) which was added to the samples as As(III) prior to the dissolution procedure. The full recovery of As(V) at 104 +/- 7{\%} (n=5) indicated good analytical accuracy. The uncertified inorganic arsenic content in the certified reference material TORT-2 was 0.186 +/- 0.014 ng g(-1) (n=6). The method was employed for the determination of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic in 60 fish samples including salmon from fresh and saline waters and in plaice. The majority of the results for inorganic arsenic were lower than the LOD of 3 ng g(-1), which corresponded to less than one per thousand of the total arsenic content in the fish samples. For mackerel, however, the recovery of As(III) was incomplete and the method was not suited for this fat-rich fish.},

This analysis used urinary arsenic measurements at baseline (1989-1991) and spirometry at Visit 2 (1993-1995) from 2132 participants to evaluate associations of arsenic exposure with airflow obstruction, restrictive pattern, self-reported respiratory disease, and symptoms. Results: Airflow obstruction was present in 21.5{\%} and restrictive pattern was present in 14.4{\%}. The odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) for obstruction and restrictive patterns, based on the fixed ratio definition, comparing the 75th to 25th percentile of arsenic, was 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and 1.27 (1.01, 1.60), respectively, after adjustments, and 1.28 (1.02, 1.60) and 1.33 (0.90, 1.50), respectively, based on the lower limit of normal definition. Arsenic was associated with lower percent predicted FEV1 and FVC, self-reported emphysema and stopping for breath. Conclusion: Low-moderate arsenic exposure was positively associated with restrictive pattern, airflow obstruction, lower lung function, self-reported emphysema and stopping for breath, independent of smoking and other lung disease risk factors. Findings suggest that low-moderate arsenic exposure may contribute to restrictive lung disease.},

The study population included 232 pairs of pregnant women and their infants at 6 months of age. Maternal blood manganese was measured at term, just before delivery. Mental and psychomotor development in infancy was assessed at 6 months of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The relationship between maternal blood manganese level and the mental and psychomotor development indexes (MDI and PDI) was estimated for manganese modeled as a linear and as a categorical variable and using penalized splines for nonlinear modeling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Mean $\pm$ SD maternal blood manganese concentration was 22.5 $\pm$ 6.5 $\mu$g/L. After adjustment for potential confounders, blood manganese was used as a continuous variable in a linear and nonlinear model. Associations between maternal blood manganese and MDI and PDI scores followed an inverted U-shape dose-response curve after adjustment for potential confounders, with lower scores associated with both low and high blood concentrations [MDI: likelihood-ratio test (LRT) p = 0.075, PDI: LRT p = 0.038]. Associations of both outcomes with increasing blood manganese shifted from positive to negative at concentrations of 24-28 $\mu$g/L in this cohort of term, normal birth weight children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Although no cut-off point has been established to define manganese toxicity, both high and low blood manganese levels may be associated with neurobehavioral function in infants.},

	abstract = {Restrictive lung diseases are a heterogeneous set of pulmonary disorders defined by restrictive patterns on spirometry. These disorders are characterized by a reduced distensibility of the lungs, compromising lung expansion, and, in turn, reduced lung volumes, particularly with reduced total lung capacity (TLC).[1] These functional and other characteristics allow to differentiate them from obstructive pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, asthma, emphysema, and bronchiolitis characterized by increased resistance to flow due to obstruction partial or complete at any level, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles. In numerical terms, restrictive syndromes account for about a fifth of pulmonary syndromes, while obstructive syndromes are the majority (80{\%}).[2] Restrictive lung diseases may be caused by the destruction of distal lung parenchyma due to infiltrates from inflammation, toxins, and mechanisms yet to be elucidated (intrinsic conditions) as well as extra parenchymal conditions (extrinsic causes). Within the former group, there are diseases characterized by inflammatory changes involving the alveolar interstitium with possible involvement of the peripheral bronchial structures. The conditions leading to this destruction are encompassed among the interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). This term refers to an umbrella with numerous disorders that are characterized by diffuse cellular infiltrates in a periacinar location, including clinical conditions that vary from occasional self-limited inflammatory processes to severe debilitating fibrosis of the lungs. Other conditions originate from within the alveolus (e.g., edema, hemorrhage) and spread to interstitial structures. If the process starts from the interstitium or from the alveolus, in both cases, alteration of the lung architecture, which reverberates into functional impairment occurs. On the other hand, restrictive lung diseases may also result from limitations in neuromuscular function and chest wall movements (extrinsic causes). These may be due to neuromuscular diseases, pleural disorders, obesity, costosternal or costovertebral fusion, a fusion or deviation of the thoracic vertebra, and other etiologies that result in a physical impediment to inspiration.[3] Regardless of the intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms, these diseases are featured by impaired ventilatory function and respiratory failure. A brief review of the restrictive lung diseases would be discussed. Because the topic is vast, here we have prepared an overview of the disorders, including their diagnosis, treatment, and more.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diarrhea-associated deaths among US children increased from the mid-1980s through 2006, particularly among infants. Understanding risk factors for diarrhea-associated death could improve prevention strategies. METHODS: Records of singleton infants with diarrhea listed anywhere on the death certificate were selected from the US Linked Birth/Infant Death data for the period, 2005 to 2007; characteristics of these infants were compared with those of infants who survived their first year. RESULTS: During 2005 to 2007, 1087 diarrhea-associated infant deaths were reported; 86{\%} occurred among low birth weight (LBW, {\textless}2500 g) infants. Compared with normal birth weight (NBW, ≥2500 g) infants, LBW infants had a greater mortality rate (risk ratio: 91.9, 95{\%} confidence interval: 77.4-109.0) and younger median age at death (7 versus 15 weeks, P{\textless}0.0001). The most common codiagnoses for diarrhea-associated death among LBW and NBW infants were sepsis (26{\%}) and volume depletion (20{\%}), respectively. Among LBW infants, 97{\%} of diarrhea-associated deaths occurred in inpatient settings, whereas 27{\%} of NBW infant deaths occurred in outpatient settings and 5.3{\%} in the decedent's home. Male sex, black race, unmarried status and low 5-minute Apgar score ({\textless}7) increased mortality odds among LBW infants whereas, among NBW infants, low 5-minute Apgar score, black race, young maternal age ({\textless}25 years) and high birth order (third or more) increased mortality odds. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce diarrhea-associated morality should focus on understanding and improving management of diarrhea in vulnerable LBW infants. For prevention of diarrhea-associated deaths in NBW infants, educating mothers who fit the high-risk profile regarding home hydration therapy and timely access to medical treatment is important.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A commonly used approach to adjust for urine dilution in analyses of biomarkers is to adjust for urinary creatinine. However Creatinine is a product of muscle mass and is therefore associated with body mass. In studies of urinary analytes and obesity or obesity-related outcomes Controlling for creatinine could induce collider stratification bias. We illustrate this phenomenon with an analysis of urinary arsenic. Objective: We aimed to evaluate various approaches of adjustment for urinary dilution on the associations between urinary arsenic concentration and measures of obesity. Methods: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey We regressed body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratios on urinary arsenic concentrations. We compared eight approaches to account for urine dilution Including standardization by urinary creatinine Osmolality And flow rates And inclusion of these metrics as independent covariates. We also used a recently proposed method known as covariate-adjusted standardization. Results: Inverse associations between urinary arsenic concentration with BMI and waist-to-height ratio were observed when either creatinine or osmolality were used to standardize or as covariates. Not adjusting for dilution Standardizing or adjusting for urinary flow rate And using covariate- adjusted standardization resulted in null associations observed between arsenic concentration in relation to BMI and waist-to-height ratio. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that arsenic exposure is not associated with obesity And that urinary creatinine and osmolality may be colliders on the causal pathway from arsenic exposure to obesity As common descendants of hydration and body composition. In studies of urinary biomarkers and obesity or obesity-related outcomes Alternative metrics such as urinary flow rate or analytic strategies such as covariate-adjusted standardization should be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic (As) exposure is a significant worldwide environmental health concern. Chronic exposure via contaminated drinking water has been associated with an increased incidence of a number of diseases, including reproductive and developmental effects. The goal of this study was to identify adverse outcomes in a mouse model of early life exposure to low-dose drinking water As (10 ppb, current U.S. EPA Maximum Contaminant Level).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: C57B6/J pups were exposed to 10 ppb As, via the dam in her drinking water, either in utero and/or during the postnatal period. Birth outcomes, the growth of the F1 offspring, and health of the dams were assessed by a variety of measurements. Birth outcomes including litter weight, number of pups, and gestational length were unaffected. However, exposure during the in utero and postnatal period resulted in significant growth deficits in the offspring after birth, which was principally a result of decreased nutrients in the dam's breast milk. Cross-fostering of the pups reversed the growth deficit. Arsenic exposed dams displayed altered liver and breast milk triglyceride levels and serum profiles during pregnancy and lactation. The growth deficits in the F1 offspring resolved following separation from the dam and cessation of exposure in male mice, but did not resolve in female mice up to six weeks of age.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure to As at the current U.S. drinking water standard during critical windows of development induces a number of adverse health outcomes for both the dam and offspring. Such effects may contribute to the increased disease risks observed in human populations.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) uptake by rice is largely determined by As speciation, which is strongly influenced by microbial activities. However, little is known about interactions between root and rhizosphere microbes, particularly on arsenic oxidation and reduction. In this study, two rice cultivars with different radial oxygen loss (ROL) ability were used to investigate the impact of microbially mediated As redox changes in the rhizosphere on As uptake. Results showed that the cultivar with higher ROL (Yangdao) had lower As uptake than that with lower ROL (Nongken). The enhancement of the rhizospheric effect on the abundance of the arsenite (As(III)) oxidase gene (aroA-like) was greater than on the arsenate (As(V)) reductase gene (arsC), and As(V) respiratory reductase gene (arrA), resulting in As oxidation and sequestration in the rhizosphere, particularly for cultivar Yangdao. The community of As(III)-oxidizing bacteria in the rhizosphere was dominated by $\alpha$-Proteobacteria and $\beta$-Proteobacteria and was influenced by rhizospheric effects, rice straw application, growth stage, and cultivar. Application of rice straw into the soil increased As release and accumulation into rice plants. These results highlighted that uptake of As by rice is influenced by microbial processes, especially As oxidation in the rhizosphere, and these processes are influenced by root ROL and organic matter application.},

Because little is known about early-life effects of arsenic on immunity, we evaluated the impact of in utero exposure on infant immune parameters and morbidity in a pilot study. Pregnant women were enrolled at 6-10 weeks of gestation in Matlab, a rural area of Bangladesh, extensively affected by arsenic contamination of tubewell water. Women (n = 140) delivering at local clinics were included in the study. Anthropometry and morbidity data of the pregnant women and their children, as well as infant thymic size by sonography were collected. Maternal urine and breast milk were collected for immune marker and arsenic assessment. Maternal urinary arsenic during pregnancy showed significant negative correlation with interleukin-7 (IL-7) and lactoferrin (Ltf) in breast milk and child thymic index (TI). Urinary arsenic was also positively associated with fever and diarrhea during pregnancy and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the infants. The effect of arsenic exposure on ARI was only evident in male children. The findings suggest that in utero arsenic exposure impaired child thymic development and enhanced morbidity, probably via immunosuppression. The effect seemed to be partially gender dependent. Arsenic exposure also affected breast milk content of trophic factors and maternal morbidity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water has the potential to  cause adverse pregnancy outcomes, although the association has not been demonstrated conclusively. This cross-sectional study assessed the association between arsenic in drinking water and spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and neonatal death. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 533 women were interviewed. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, drinking water use, and adverse pregnancy outcomes was obtained through a structured pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. The respondents reported use of a total of 223 tube wells; for 208 wells, water samples were measured using an ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry method, whereas 15 were measured by flow-injection hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FIHG-AAS). RESULTS: Excess risks for spontaneous abortion and stillbirth were observed among the participants chronically exposed to higher concentrations of arsenic in drinking water after adjusting for participant's height, history of hypertension and diabetes, and (for neonatal death only) age at first pregnancy. Comparing exposure to arsenic concentration of greater than 50 microg/L with 50 microg/L or less, the odds ratios were 2.5 (95{\%} confidence interval=1.5-4.3) for spontaneous abortion, 2.5 (1.3-4.9) for stillbirth, and 1.8 (0.9-3.6) for neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: These study findings suggest that chronic arsenic exposure may increase the risk of fetal and infant death.},

We assessed the impact of different asthma definitions on prevalence estimates and on the prediction model's performances. We searched PubMed and extracted data of definitions used to diagnose childhood asthma (between 6 and 18 yrs) in cohort studies. Next, using data from an ongoing cohort study (n=186), we constructed and compared four prediction models which all predict asthma at age 6 yrs, using a fixed set of predictors and four different definitions in turn. We defined an area of clinical indecision (posterior probability between 25{\%} and 60{\%}) and calculated the number of children who remained inside this area. 122 papers yielded 60 different definitions. Prevalence estimates varied between 15.1{\%} and 51.1{\%} depending on the asthma definition used. The percentage of children whose posterior asthma probability was in the area of clinical indecision varied from 14.9{\%} to 65.3{\%}. Variation in definitions and its effect on the performance of prediction models may be another source of otherwise inexplicable variation in daily clinical decision making. More uniformity of operational asthma definitions seems needed. Copyright{\textcopyright}ERS 2010.},

	abstract = {Use of excess water in cooking of rice is a well-studied short-term arsenic removal technique. However, the outcome on the nutritional content of rice is not well addressed. We determined the benefit of different cooking techniques on arsenic removal and the associated risk of losing the essential elements in rice. Overall, we found 4.5{\%}, 30{\%}, and 44{\%} decrease in the arsenic content of rice when cooked with rice-to-water ratios of 1:3, 1:6 (p = 0.004), and 1:10 (parboiling; p {\textless} 0.0001), respectively. All the essential elements (except iron, selenium, and copper) incurred a significant loss when rice was cooked using the 1:6 technique: potassium (50{\%}), nickel (44.6{\%}), molybdenum (38.5{\%}), magnesium (22.4{\%}), cobalt (21.2{\%}), manganese (16.5{\%}), calcium (14.5{\%}), selenium (12{\%}), iron (8.2{\%}), zinc (7.7{\%}), and copper (0.2{\%}) and further reduction was observed on parboiling, except for iron. For the same cooking method (1:6), percentage contribution to the recommended daily intake (RDI) of essential elements was highest for molybdenum (154.7{\%}), followed by manganese (34.5{\%}), copper (33.4{\%}), selenium (13.1{\%}), nickel (12.4{\%}), zinc (10{\%}), magnesium (8{\%}), iron (6.3{\%}), potassium (1.8{\%}), and calcium (0.5{\%}). Hence, cooked rice as a staple is a poor source for essential elements and thus micronutrients.},

	abstract = {Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased respiratory disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protects the lung against tissue destruction. The objective of this study was to determine whether arsenic exposure is associated with changes in airway AAT concentration and whether this relationship is modified by selenium. A total of 55 subjects were evaluated in Ajo and Tucson, Arizona. Tap water and first morning void urine were analyzed for arsenic species, induced sputum for AAT and toenails for selenium and arsenic. Household tap-water arsenic, toenail arsenic and urinary inorganic arsenic and metabolites were significantly higher in Ajo (20.6$\pm$3.5 $\mu$g/l, 0.54$\pm$0.77 $\mu$g/g and 27.7$\pm$21.2 $\mu$g/l, respectively) than in Tucson (3.9$\pm$2.5 $\mu$g/l, 0.16$\pm$0.20 $\mu$g/g and 13.0$\pm$13.8 $\mu$g/l, respectively). In multivariable models, urinary monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) was negatively, and toenail selenium positively associated with sputum AAT (P=0.004 and P=0.002, respectively). In analyses stratified by town, these relationships remained significant only in Ajo, with the higher arsenic exposure. Reduction in AAT may be a means by which arsenic induces respiratory disease, and selenium may protect against this adverse effect.},

	abstract = {Factors responsible for paddy soil arsenic accumulation in the tubewell irrigated systems of the Bengal Delta were investigated. Baseline (i.e., nonirrigated) and paddy soils were collected from 30 field systems across Bangladesh. For each field, soil sampled at dry season (Boro) harvest i.e., the crop cycle irrigated with tubewell water, was collected along a 90 m transect away from the tubewell irrigation source. Baseline soil arsenic levels ranged from 0.8 to 21. mg/kg, with lower values found on the Pliestocene Terrace around Gazipur (average, 1.6 +/- 0.2 mg/kg), and higher levels found in Holecene sediment tracts of Jessore and Faridpur (average, 6.6 +/- 1.0 mg/kg). Two independent approaches were used to assess the extent of arsenic build-up in irrigated paddy soils. First, arsenic build-up in paddy soil at the end of dry season production (irrigated - baseline soil arsenic) was regressed against number of years irrigated and tubewell arsenic concentration. Years of irrigation was not significant (P = 0.711), indicating no year-on-year arsenic build-up, whereas tubewell As concentration was significant (P = 0.008). The second approach was analysis of irrigated soils for 20 fields over 2 successive years. For nine of the fields there was a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) decrease in soil arsenic from year 1 to 2, one field had a significant increase, whereas there was no change for the remaining 10. Over the dry season irrigation cycle, soil arsenic built-up in soils at a rate dependent on irrigation tubewell water, 35* (tubewell water concentration in mg/kg, triple bond mg/L). Grain arsenic rises steeply at low soil/shoot arsenic levels, plateauing out at concentratations. Baseline soil arsenic at Faridpur sites corresponded to grain arsenic levels at the start of this saturation phase. Therefore, variation in baseline levels of soil arsenic leads to a large range in grain arsenic. Where sites have high baseline soil arsenic, further additional arsenic from irrigation water only leads to a gradual increase in grain arsenic concentration.},

	abstract = {Adverse health outcomes, including death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), arising from chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) are well documented. Consumption of rice is a major iAs exposure route for over 3 billion people, however, there is still a lack of epidemiological evidence demonstrating the association between iAs exposure from rice intake and CVD risks. We explored this potential association through an ecological study using data at local authority level across England and Wales. Local authority level daily per capita iAs exposure from rice (E-iAsing,rice) was estimated using ethnicity as a proxy for class of rice consumption. A series of linear and non-linear models were applied to estimate the association between E-iAsing,rice and CVD age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), using Akaike's Information Criterion as the principle model selection criterion. When adjusted for significant confounders, notably smoking prevalence, education level, employment rate, overweight percentage, PM2.5, female percentage and medical and care establishments, the preferred non-linear model indicated that CVD risks increased with iAs exposure from rice at exposures above 0.3 $\mu$g/person/day. Also, the best-fitted linear model indicated that CVD ASMR in the highest quartile of iAs exposure (0.375--2.71 $\mu$g/person/day) was 1.06 (1.02, 1.11; p-trend {\textless}0.001) times higher than that in the lowest quartile ({\textless}0.265 $\mu$g/person/day). Notwithstanding the well-known limitations of ecological studies, this study further suggests exposure to iAs, including from rice intake, as a potentially important confounder for studies of the factors controlling CVD risks.},

Publication of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans prompted an interagency working group to update the HEI. The HEI-2010 retains several features of the 2005 version: (a) it has 12 components, many unchanged, including nine adequacy and three moderation components; (b) it uses a density approach to set standards, eg, per 1,000 calories or as a percentage of calories; and (c) it employs leastrestrictive standards; ie, those that are easiest to achieve among recommendations that vary by energy level, sex, and/or age. Changes to the index include: (a) the Greens and Beans component replaces Dark Green and Orange Vegetables and Legumes; (b) Seafood and Plant Proteins has been added to capture specific choices from the protein group; (c) Fatty Acids, a ratio of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated to saturated fatty acids, replaces Oils and Saturated Fat to acknowledge the recommendation to replace saturated fat with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; and (d) a moderation component, Refined Grains, replaces the adequacy component, Total Grains, to assess overconsumption. The HEI-2010 captures the key recommendations of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines and, like earlier versions, will be used to assess the diet quality of the US population and subpopulations, evaluate interventions, research dietary patterns, and evaluate various aspects of the food environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

	abstract = {In order to assess mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and arsenic (As) exposure in the Mediterranean area, total mercury (THg), monomethylmercury (MeHg), Se and As levels were measured in umbilical cord blood and breast milk from Italian (n=900), Slovenian (n=584), Croatian (n=234) and Greek (n=484) women. THg, MeHg, As, and Se levels were also determined in blood samples of the same mothers from Italy and Croatia. In addition, THg and MeHg were determined in the same women's hair from all the countries involved in this study and As and Se levels were determined in the mother's urine samples from Italy, Croatia and Greece. Besides recording the consumption of other food items, the frequencies of fish consumption were assessed by detailed food frequency questionnaires, since fish represents an important source of Hg, Se and As in humans. The highest levels of THg and As were found in cord blood (Med(THg)=5.8ng/g; Med(As)=3.3ng/g) and breast milk (Med(THg)=0.6ng/g; Med(As)=0.8ng/g) from Greek women, while the highest Se levels were found in cord blood (Med=113ng/g) from Italy. Significant linear correlations were found between Hg, Se and As in blood, cord blood and breast milk. In addition, significant relations were found between the frequencies of total fish consumption and biomarkers of As, MeHg and Se exposure, with the strongest Spearman rank coefficients between frequencies of total fish consumption and THg levels in cord blood (rs=0.442, p{\textless}0.001) or THg levels in hair (rs=0.421, p{\textless}0.001), and between frequencies of total fish consumption and As levels in cord blood (rs=0.350, p{\textless}0.001). The differences in Hg and As exposure between countries were probably due to different amounts of fish consumption and the consumption of different species of fish of different origin, while the highest Se levels in women from Italy were probably the consequence of the more frequent consumption of different non specific food items. Moreover, fish consumption, the possible common source of As, Hg and Se intake, could explain the correlations between the elements determined in cord blood, mother's blood or breast milk. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The present study was designed to explore whether polymorphisms and haplotypes of arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT), glutathione-S-transferase omegas (GSTOs), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) affect arsenic methylation capacity and developmental delay. A case-control study was conducted from August 2010 to March 2014. All participants were recruited from the Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Teaching Hospital. In total, 179 children with developmental delay and 88 children without delay were recruited. Urinary arsenic species, including arsenite (AsIII), arsenate (AsV), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography-linked hydride generator and atomic absorption spectrometry. The polymorphisms of AS3MT, GSTO, and PNP were performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform with iPLEX Gold chemistry. Polymorphisms of AS3MT genes were found to affect susceptibility to developmental delay in children, but GSTO and PNP polymorphisms were not. Participants with AS3MT rs3740392 A/G + G/G genotype, compared with AS3MT rs3740392 A/A genotype, had a significantly lower secondary methylation index. This may result in an increased OR for developmental delay. Participants with the AS3MT high-risk haplotype had a significantly higher OR than those with AS3MT low-risk haplotypes [OR and 95{\%} CI, 1.59 (1.08--2.34)]. This is the first study to show a joint dose-response effect of this AS3MT high-risk haplotype and inefficient arsenic methylation capacity on developmental delay. Our data provide evidence that AS3MT genes are related to developmental delay and may partially influence arsenic methylation capacity.},

We measured direct fetal exposure to three metals (lead, manganese and zinc) during the second and third trimester and examined its association with birth weight and gestational age at delivery. Participants in the Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy and Asthma Longitudinal Study (WHEALS), a population-based birth cohort established between September 2003 and December 2007, were invited to donate teeth to the study. Lead, manganese and zinc during the second and third trimesters were measured via high-resolution microspatial mapping of dentin growth rings, a validated biomarker for prenatal metal exposure. Gestational age at delivery and infant birth weight were obtained from the delivery medical record. A total of 145 children had tooth metal measurements and birth outcome data. Mean birth weight was 3431 $\pm$ 472 g and mean gestational age at delivery was 39.0 $\pm$ 1.3 weeks. Overall, there was a positive association between second ($\beta$ = 0.21, 95{\%} CI: 0.05, 0.37, P = 0.01) and third trimester ($\beta$ = 0.21, 95{\%} CI: 0.05, 0.37, P = 0.01) tooth manganese and birth weight Z-score; this remained statistically significant after covariate adjustment. There was also a negative association between second trimester tooth lead level and birth weight Z-score ($\beta$ = −0.20, 95{\%} CI: −0.38, −0.02, P = 0.02), however, this was attenuated after adjusting for covariates. Mixture analysis revealed similar findings. There was evidence for a sex-specific effect of manganese with birth weight Z-score, with the association stronger in female compared to male infants. Overall, we found evidence suggesting that higher in utero manganese is associated with larger birth weight Z-scores and that these associations may vary by infant sex.},

exposure. The first two PC scores significantly varied by cluster,
indicating that some of these profiles could be identified using both
methods. Cluster membership and PCA scores were associated with race,
marital status, consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and parity.
Future work could use clusters and PCA scores to characterize
environmental chemical mixture exposures in other cohorts of pregnant
women and predict potential health effects of environmental chemical
mixture exposure.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a human pulmonary carcinogen. Our work indicates that in utero arsenic exposure in mice can induce or initiate lung cancer in female offspring. To define early molecular changes, pregnant C3H mice were given 85 ppm arsenic in drinking water from days 8 to 18 of gestation and expression of selected genes in the fetal lung or in lung tumors developing in adults was examined. Transplacental arsenic exposure increased estrogen receptor-$\alpha$ (ER-$\alpha$) transcript and protein levels in the female fetal lung. An overexpression of various estrogen-regulated genes also occurred, including trefoil factor-3, anterior gradient-2, and the steroid metabolism genes 17-$\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 and aromatase. The insulin growth factor system, which can be influenced by ER and has been implicated in the pulmonary oncogenic process, was activated in fetal lung after gestational arsenic exposure. In utero arsenic exposure also induced overexpression of $\alpha$-fetoprotein, epidermal growth factor receptor, L-myc, and metallothionein-1 in fetal lung, all of which are associated with lung cancer. Lung adenoma and adenocarcinoma from adult female mice exposed to arsenic in utero showed widespread, intense nuclear ER-$\alpha$ expression. In contrast, normal adult lung and diethylnitrosamine-induced lung adenocarcinoma showed little evidence of ER-$\alpha$ expression. Thus, transplacental arsenic exposure at a carcinogenic dose produced aberrant estrogen-linked pulmonary gene expression. ER-$\alpha$ activation was specifically associated with arsenic-induced lung adenocarcinoma and adenoma but not with nitrosamine-induced lung tumors. These data provide evidence that arsenic-induced aberrant ER signaling could disrupt early life stage genetic programing in the lung leading eventually to lung tumor formation much later in adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

@article{Hong2014,
	abstract = {Arsenic is a unique element with distinct physical characteristics and toxicity whose importance in public health is well recognized. The toxicity of arsenic varies across its different forms. While the carcinogenicity of arsenic has been confirmed, the mechanisms behind the diseases occurring after acute or chronic exposure to arsenic are not well understood. Inorganic arsenic has been confirmed as a human carcinogen that can induce skin, lung, and bladder cancer. There are also reports of its significant association to liver, prostate, and bladder cancer. Recent studies have also suggested a relationship with diabetes, neurological effects, cardiac disorders, and reproductive organs, but further studies are required to confirm these associations. The majority of research to date has examined cancer incidence after a high exposure to high concentrations of arsenic. However, numerous studies have reported various health effects caused by chronic exposure to low concentrations of arsenic. An assessment of the health effects to arsenic exposure has never been performed in the South Korean population; thus, objective estimates of exposure levels are needed. Data should be collected on the biological exposure level for the total arsenic concentration, and individual arsenic concentration by species. In South Korea, we believe that biological exposure assessment should be the first step, followed by regular health effect assessments.},

	abstract = {Background: Maximal lung function in early adulthood is an important determinant of mortality and COPD. We investigated whether distinct trajectories of lung function are present during childhood and whether these extend to adulthood and infancy. Methods: To ascertain trajectories of FEV 1 , we studied two population-based birth cohorts (MAAS and ALSPAC) with repeat spirometry from childhood into early adulthood (1046 participants from 5--16 years and 1390 participants from 8--24 years). We used a third cohort (PIAF) with repeat lung function measures in infancy (V' maxFRC ) and childhood (FEV 1 ; 196 participants from 1 month to 18 years of age) to investigate whether these childhood trajectories extend from early life. We identified trajectories using latent profile modelling. We created an allele score to investigate genetic associations of trajectories, and constructed a multivariable model to identify their early-life predictors. Findings: We identified four childhood FEV 1 trajectories: persistently high, normal, below average, and persistently low. The persistently low trajectory (129 [5{\%}] of 2436 participants) was associated with persistent wheezing and asthma throughout follow-up. In genetic analysis, compared with the normal trajectory, the pooled relative risk ratio per allele was 0{\textperiodcentered}96 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}92--1{\textperiodcentered}01; p=0{\textperiodcentered}13) for persistently high, 1{\textperiodcentered}01 (0{\textperiodcentered}99--1{\textperiodcentered}02; p=0{\textperiodcentered}49) for below average, and 1{\textperiodcentered}05 (0{\textperiodcentered}98--1{\textperiodcentered}13; p=0{\textperiodcentered}13) for persistently low. Most children in the low V' maxFRC trajectory in infancy did not progress to the low FEV 1 trajectory in childhood. Early-life factors associated with the persistently low trajectory included recurrent wheeze with severe wheezing exacerbations, early allergic sensitisation, and tobacco smoke exposure. Interpretation: Reduction of childhood smoke exposure and minimisation of the risk of early-life sensitisation and wheezing exacerbations might reduce the risk of diminished lung function in early adulthood. Funding: None.},

Mn concentrations in tap water ranged from {\textless}0.03 to 1046$\mu$gL-1 (geometric mean 5.96$\mu$gL-1). The geometric mean of Mn intake resulting from the consumption of water was 0.25 (0-34.95) $\mu$g kg-1 day-1.

Mn in whole saliva did not correlate with Mn in water or Mn intake. Both Mn in hair and Mn in toenail allowed to discriminate the most exposed group from the least exposed group, based on Mn in water and Mn intake from water. In this group of children with low level Mn exposure, Mn concentrations in hair, and toenails reflected reasonably well Mn exposure from drinking water, whereas Mn content in saliva correlated less strongly.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has shown an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in general populations exposed to arsenic, but little is known about exposures during pregnancy and the association with gestational diabetes (GD). OBJECTIVES: We studied 532 women living proximate to the Tar Creek Superfund Site to investigate whether arsenic exposure is associated with impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. METHODS: Blood glucose was measured between 24 and 28 weeks gestation after a 1-hr oral glucose tolerance test (GTT) as part of routine prenatal care. Blood and hair were collected at delivery and analyzed for arsenic using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with dynamic reaction cell. RESULTS: Arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 24.1 microg/L (ppb) (mean +/- SD, 1.7 +/-1.5) and 1.1 to 724.4 ng/g (ppb) (mean +/- SD, 27.4 +/- 61.6) in blood and hair, respectively. One-hour glucose levels ranged from 40 to 284 mg/dL (mean +/- SD, 108.7 +/- 29.5); impaired glucose tolerance was observed in 11.9{\%} of women when using standard screening criterion ({\textgreater} 140 mg/dL). Adjusting for age, Native-American race, prepregnancy body mass index, Medicaid use, and marital status, women in the highest quartile of blood arsenic exposure had 2.8 higher odds of impaired GTT than women in the lowest quartile of exposure (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.1-6.9) (p-trend = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Among this population of pregnant women, arsenic exposure was associated with increased risk of impaired GTT at 24-28 weeks gestation and therefore may be associated with increased risk of GD.},

@article{Woodruff2014,
	abstract = {Background: Synthesizing what is known about the environmental drivers of health is instrumentalto taking prevention-oriented action. Methods of research synthesis commonly used in environmental health lag behind systematic review methods developed in the clinical sciences over the past 20 years. Objectives: We sought to develop a proof of concept of the ``Navigation Guide,'' a systematic and transparent method of research synthesis in environmental health. Discussion: The Navigation Guide methodology builds on best practices in research synthesis in evidence-based medicine and environmental health. Key points of departure from current methods of expert-based narrative review prevalent in environmental health include a prespecified protocol, standardized and transparent documentation including expert judgment, a comprehensive search strategy, assessment of ``risk of bias,'' and separation of the science from values and preferences. Key points of departure from evidence-based medicine include assigning a ``moderate'' quality rating to human observational studies and combining diverse evidence streams. Conclusions: The Navigation Guide methodology is a systematic and rigorous approach to research synthesis that has been developed to reduce bias and maximize transparency in the evaluation of environmental health information. Although novel aspects of the method will require further development and validation, our findings demonstrated that improved methods of research synthesis under development at the National Toxicology Program and under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are fully achievable. The institutionalization of robust methods of systematic and transparent review would provide a concrete mechanism for linking science to timely action to prevent harm.},

Water As was measured in the regional studies. Among subjects exposed to tap water As {\textgreater}10 p.p.b., aggregate inorganic exposure was 24.5-26.1 $\mu$g/day, with approximately 30{\%} of intake from food. Among subjects living in homes with tap water As ≤10, 5 or 3 p.p.b., aggregate inorganic As exposure was 8.6-11.8 $\mu$g/day, with 54-85{\%} of intake from food. Median inorganic As potential dose was 0.42-0.50 $\mu$g/kg BW/day in subjects exposed to tap water As {\textgreater}10 p.p.b. and less than half that among subjects exposed to tap water As ≤10 p.p.b. The majority of inorganic and total As exposure is attributable to diet in subjects with tap water As {\textless}MCL.

	abstract = {The analysis of trace elements in biological samples will extend our understanding of the impact that environmental exposure to these elements has on human health. Measuring arsenic content in nails has proven useful in studies evaluating the chronic body burden of arsenic. In this study, we developed methodology with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the determination of total arsenic in nails. We assessed the utility of the washing procedures for removing surface contamination. Four types of preanalysis treatments (water bath, sonication, water bath plus sonication, and control) after sample decomposition by nitric acid were compared to evaluate the digestion efficiencies. In addition, we studied the stability of the solution over 1 wk and the effect of acidity on the arsenic signal. Arsenic content in the digested solution was analyzed by using Ar-N2 plasma with Te as the internal standard. The results suggest that washing once with 1{\%} Triton X-100 for 20 min for cleaning nail samples prior to ICP-MS analysis is satisfactory. Repeated measurement analysis of variance revealed that there was no significant difference among the various sample preparation techniques. Moreover, the measurements were reproducible within 1 wk, and acidity seemed to have no substantial influence on the arsenic signal. A limit of detection (on the basis of three times the standard deviation of the blank measurement) of 7 ng As/g toenail was achieved with this system, and arsenic recoveries from reference materials (human hair and nails) were in good agreement (95-106{\%} recovery) with the certified/reference values of the standard reference materials. ICP-MS offers high accuracy and precision, as well as high-throughput capacity in the analysis of total arsenic in nail samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human intestine is host to an enormously complex, diverse, and vast microbial community-the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome plays a profound role in metabolic processing, energy production, immune and cognitive development, epithelial homeostasis, and so forth. However, the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome can be readily affected by external factors, which raises the possibility that exposure to toxic environmental chemicals leads to gut microbiome alteration, or dysbiosis. Arsenic exposure affects large human populations worldwide and has been linked to a number of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We investigated the impact of arsenic exposure on the gut microbiome composition and its metabolic profiles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used an integrated approach combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling to examine the functional impact of arsenic exposure on the gut microbiome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that arsenic significantly perturbed the gut microbiome composition in C57BL/6 mice after exposure to 10 ppm arsenic for 4 weeks in drinking water. Moreover, metabolomics profiling revealed a concurrent effect, with a number of gut microflora-related metabolites being perturbed in multiple biological matrices.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Arsenic exposure not only alters the gut microbiome community at the abundance level but also substantially disturbs its metabolic profiles at the function level.

Limited evidence for the deleterious effects on lung function exists among individuals exposed to a high dose of arsenic. Objectives: To determine the deleterious effects on lung function that exist among individuals exposed to a high dose of arsenic. Methods: In 950 individuals who presented with any respiratory symptom among a population-based cohort of 20,033 adults, we evaluated the association between arsenic exposure, measured by well water and urinary arsenic concentrations measured at baseline, and post- bronchodilatoradministered pulmonary function assessed during follow-up. Measurements andMainResults: For everyoneSDincrease inbaseline water arsenic exposure, we observed a lower level of FEV1 (246.5 ml; P , 0.0005) and FVC (253.1 ml; P , 0.01) in regression models adjusted for age, sex, bodymass index, smoking, socioeconomic status, betelnut use, and arsenical skin lesions status. Similar inverse relationships were observed between baseline urinary arsenic and FEV1 (248.3 ml; P , 0.005) and FVC (255.2 ml; P , 0.01) in adjustedmodels. Our analyses also demonstrated a dose-related decrease in lung function with increasing levels of baseline water and urinary arsenic. This associationremainedsignificant innever-smokersandindividuals without skin lesions, and was stronger inmale smokers. Among male smokers and individuals with skin lesions, every one SD increase in water arsenic was related to a significant reduction of FEV1 (274.4ml, P , 0.01; and 2116.1 ml, P , 0.05) and FVC (272.8 ml, P = 0.02; and 2146.9 ml, P = 0.004), respectively. Conclusions: This large population-based studyconfirms that arsenic exposure is associated with impaired lung function and the deleterious effect is evident at low- to moderate-dose range.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure causes a wide range of health effects, but little is known about critical windows of exposure. Arsenic readily crosses the placenta, but the few available data on postnatal exposure to arsenic via breast milk are not conclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: Our goal was to assess the arsenic exposure through breast milk in Bangladeshi infants, living in an area with high prevalence of arsenic-rich tube-well water.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We analyzed metabolites of inorganic arsenic in breast milk and infant urine at 3 months of age and compared them with detailed information on breast-feeding practices and maternal arsenic exposure, as measured by concentrations in blood, urine, and saliva.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in breast-milk samples were low (median, 1 microg/kg; range, 0.25-19 microg/kg), despite high arsenic exposures via drinking water (10-1,100 microg/L in urine and 2-40 microg/L in red blood cells). Accordingly, the arsenic concentrations in urine of infants whose mothers reported exclusive breast-feeding were low (median, 1.1 microg/L; range, 0.3-29 microg/L), whereas concentrations for those whose mothers reported partial breast-feeding ranged from 0.4 to 1,520 microg/L (median 1.9 microg/L). The major part of arsenic in milk was inorganic. Still, the infants had a high fraction (median, 87{\%}) of the dimethylated arsenic metabolite in urine. Arsenic in breast milk was associated with arsenic in maternal blood, urine, and saliva.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Very little arsenic is excreted in breast milk, even in women with high exposure from drinking water. Thus, exclusive breast-feeding protects the infant from exposure to arsenic.},

	abstract = {The present study aims to assess the arsenic (As) levels into dust samples and its implications for human health, of four ecological zones of Pakistan, which included northern frozen mountains (FMZ), lower Himalyian wet mountains (WMZ), alluvial riverine plains (ARZ), and low lying agricultural areas (LLZ). Human nail samples (N=180) of general population were also collected from the similar areas and all the samples were analysed by using ICP-MS. In general the higher levels (p{\textless}0.05) in paired dust and human nail samples were observed from ARZ and LLZ than those of other mountainous areas (i.e., WMZ and FMZ), respectively. Current results suggested that elevated As concentrations were associated to both natural, (e.g. geogenic influences) and anthropogenic sources. Linear regression model values indicated that As levels into dust samples were associated with altitude (r2=0.23), soil carbonate carbon density (SCC; r2=0.33), and population density (PD; r2=0.25). The relationship of paired dust and nail samples was also investigated and associations were found for As-nail and soil organic carbon density (SOC; r2=0.49) and SCC (r2=0.19) in each studied zone, evidencing the dust exposure as an important source of arsenic contamination in Pakistan. Risk estimation reflected higher hazard index (HI) values of non-carcinogenic risk (HI{\textgreater}1) for children populations in all areas (except FMZ), and for adults in LLZ (0.74) and ARZ (0.55), suggesting that caution should be paid about the dust exposure. Similarly, carcinogenic risk assessment also highlighted potential threats to the residents of LLZ and ARZ, as in few cases (5-10{\%}) the values exceeded the range of US-EPA threshold limits (10-6-10-4).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic is an ubiquitous element linked to carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, as well as adverse respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and dermal health effects.

OBJECTIVE: Identify dietary sources of speciated arsenic: monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA).

METHODS: Age-stratified, sample-weighted regression of NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2003-2010 data (∼8,300 participants ≥6 years old) characterized the association between urinary arsenic species and the additional mass consumed of USDA-standardized food groups (24-hour dietary recall data), controlling for potential confounders.

RESULTS: For all arsenic species, the rank-order of age strata for median urinary molar concentration was children 6-11 years {\textgreater} adults 20-84 years {\textgreater} adolescents 12-19 years, and for all age strata, the rank-order was DMA {\textgreater} MMA. Median urinary molar concentrations of methylated arsenic species ranged from 0.56 to 3.52 µmol/mol creatinine. Statistically significant increases in urinary arsenic species were associated with increased consumption of: fish (DMA); fruits (DMA, MMA); grain products (DMA, MMA); legumes, nuts, seeds (DMA); meat, poultry (DMA); rice (DMA, MMA); rice cakes/crackers (DMA, MMA); and sugars, sweets, beverages (MMA). And, for adults, rice beverage/milk (DMA, MMA). In addition, based on US (United States) median and 90th percentile consumption rates of each food group, exposure from the following food groups was highlighted: fish; fruits; grain products; legumes, nuts, seeds; meat, poultry; and sugars, sweets, beverages.

CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population, fish (adults), rice (children), and rice cakes/crackers (adolescents) had the largest associations with urinary DMA. For MMA, rice beverage/milk (adults) and rice cakes/crackers (children, adolescents) had the largest associations.},

That was the case for two advisors to the U.S. National Children's Health Study, who resigned when the study design was changed so that representativeness was threatened. 2 We admire people who take a stand for principle over expediency, but what exactly is the principle that representativeness embodies?

Diet was assessed at Gestation Week 28 and at Postpartum Month 1, using a locally-validated dish-based semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire. Toenail As concentration was analyzed by microwave-assisted acid digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Associations between natural log-transformed consumption of individual food items and temporally matched natural log-transformed toenail As concentration were quantified using general linear models that accounted for As concentration in the primary drinking water source and other potential confounders. The analysis was stratified by As in drinking water (≤50 $\mu$g/L versus {\textgreater}50 $\mu$g/L) and the time of dietary assessment (Gestation Week 28 versus Postpartum Week 1). Interestingly, toenail As was not significantly associated with consumption of plain rice as hypothesized. However, toenail As was positively associated with consumption of several vegetable, fish and meat items and was negatively associated with consumption of rice, cereal, fruits, and milk based food items. Further studies in pregnant women are needed to compare As metabolism at different levels of As exposure and the interaction between dietary composition and As absorption.},

	abstract = {Arsenic in drinking water causes increased mortality from several cancers, ischemic heart disease, bronchiectasis, and other diseases. This paper presents the first evidence relating arsenic exposure to pulmonary tuberculosis, by estimating mortality rate ratios for Region II of Chile compared with Region V for the years 1958-2000. The authors compared mortality rate ratios with time patterns of arsenic exposure, which increased abruptly in 1958 in Region II and then declined starting in 1971. Tuberculosis mortality rate ratios in men started increasing in 1968, 10 years after high arsenic exposure commenced. The peak male 5-year mortality rate ratio occurred during 1982-1986 (rate ratio = 2.1, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.7, 2.6; P {\textless} 0.001) and subsequently declined. Mortality rates in women were also elevated but with fewer excess pulmonary tuberculosis deaths (359 among men and 95 among women). The clear rise and fall of tuberculosis mortality rate ratios in men following high arsenic exposure are consistent with a causal relation. The findings are biologically plausible in view of evidence that arsenic is an immunosuppressant and also a cause of chronic lung disease. Finding weaker associations in women is unsurprising, because this is true of most arsenic-caused health effects. Confirmatory evidence is needed from other arsenic-exposed populations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

The mean hair and toenail arsenic levels were 0.31 ppm and 0.70 ppm, respectively. The correlation coefficient between log-transformed values of hair and toenail arsenic levels was 0.16 (p=0.051). After excluding a subject with hair and toenail arsenic levels as high as 1.12 ppm and 4.72 ppm, respectively, the correlation coefficient was 0.27 (p=0.001). Arsenic levels observed in the present study were relatively higher than in most developed countries. Hair or toenail arsenic concentration was not affected by sex, area of origin, place of residence and education, but toenail arsenic levels increased with age (p=0.029). Fish consumption was inversely related to arsenic levels, suggesting that consumption of beans , which are the main staple of poor people living in the study area who cannot afford to eat fish frequently, may be the source of arsenic exposure among the residents of Lahore and its suburban areas. The mean hair and toenail cadmium levels in the present study were 0.08 ppm and 0.05 ppm, respectively. The correlation coefficient between log-transformed values of hair and toenail cadmium levels was 0.17 (p=0.034). Cadmium levels were lower compared to those reported from developed countries, including Japan. The mean hair and toenail lead levels were 3.53 ppm and 2.11 ppm, respectively. The correlation coefficient between log-transformed values of hair and toenail lead levels was 0.15, which was not statistically significant (p=0.055). When a female subject with toenail lead of 52.4 ppm was excluded, the correlation was 0.17 (p=0.036). Lead levels observed in the present study were similar to those reported from developed countries. In the present study, relatively high lead toenail values were observed among children. The levels of cadmium and lead in hair but not in toenails were higher among those living in central Lahore than among those living outside Lahore, suggesting that dust containing those heavy metals was attached to hair samples due to a typical urban environment with heavy traffic load, congested population and industrial activities},

	abstract = {Background: Disruption of fundamental biologic processes and associated signaling events may result in clinically significant alterations in lung development. Objectives: We reviewed evidence on the impact of environmental chemicals on lung development and key signaling events in lung morphogenesis, and the relevance of potential outcomes to public health and regulatory science.Data sources: We evaluated the peer-reviewed literature on developmental lung biology and toxicology, mechanistic studies, and supporting epidemiology. Data synthesis: Lung function in infancy predicts pulmonary function throughout life. In utero and early postnatal exposures influence both childhood and adult lung structure and function and may predispose individuals to chronic obstructive lung disease and other disorders. The nutritional and endogenous chemical environment affects development of the lung and can result in altered function in the adult. Studies now suggest that similar adverse impacts may occur in animals and humans after exposure to environmentally relevant doses of certain xenobiotics during critical windows in early life. Potential mechanisms include interference with highly conserved factors in developmental processes such as gene regulation, molecular signaling, and growth factors involved in branching morphogenesis and alveolarization. Conclusions: Assessment of environmental chemical impacts on the lung requires studies that evaluate specific alterations in structure or function-end points not regularly assessed in standard toxicity tests. Identifying effects on important signaling events may inform protocols of developmental toxicology studies. Such knowledge may enable policies promoting true primary prevention of lung diseases. Evidence of relevant signaling disruption in the absence of adequate developmental toxicology data should influence the size of the uncertainty factors used in risk assessments.},

	abstract = {During the summer of 1955, mass arsenic poisoning of bottle-fed infants occurred in the western part of Japan due to contaminated milk powder, and more than 100 died; some childhood victims were later found to suffer from neurological sequelae in adolescence. This unique incident enabled us to explore infancy as a critical period of arsenic exposure in regard to developmental neurotoxicity and its possible persistence through adulthood. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the association between developmental arsenic exposure and the neurological outcomes more than 50. years later. We conducted a retrospective cohort study during the period from April 2012 to February 2013 in two hospitals in Okayama Prefecture, Japan. The study sample consisted of 50 individuals: 27 known poisoning victims from Okayama Prefecture, and 23 non-exposed local controls of similar age. In addition to neurological examination, we adapted a battery of neurophysiological and neuropsychological tests to identify the types of brain functions affected by early-life arsenic exposure. While limited abnormalities were found in the neurophysiological tests, neuropsychological deficits were observed. Except for Finger tapping, all test scores in the exposed group - Vocabulary and Block Design from Wechsler Adults Intelligent Scale III, Design memory subtest from Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning 2, and Grooved pegboard test - were substantially below those obtained by the unexposed. The exposed group showed average performance at least 1.2 standard deviations below the average for the controls. Exposed participants performed less well than controls, even after exclusion of subjects with recognized disabilities or those with a high level of education. Adults who had suffered arsenic poisoning during infancy revealed neuropsychological dysfunctions, even among those subjects not recognized as having disabilities. Developmental neurotoxicity due to arsenic likely results in permanent changes in brain functions.},

	abstract = {One of cadmium's major exposure routes to humans is through rice consumption. The concentrations of cadmium in the global polished (white), market rice supply-chain were assessed in 2270 samples, purchased from retailers across 32 countries, encompassing 6 continents. It was found on a global basis that East Africa had the lowest cadmium with a median for both Malawi and Tanzania at 4.9 $\mu$g/kg, an order of magnitude lower than the highest country, China with a median at 69.3 $\mu$g/kg. The Americas were typically low in cadmium, but the Indian sub-continent was universally elevated. In particular certain regions of Bangladesh had high cadmium, that when combined with the high daily consumption rate of rice of that country, leads to high cadmium exposures. Concentrations of cadmium were compared to the European Standard for polished rice of 200 $\mu$g/kg and 5{\%} of the global supply-chain exceeded this threshold. For the stricter standard of 40 $\mu$g/kg for processed infant foods, for which rice can comprise up to 100{\%} by composition (such as rice porridges, puffed rice cereal and cakes), 25{\%} of rice would not be suitable for making pure rice baby foods. Given that rice is also elevated in inorganic arsenic, the only region of the world where both inorganic arsenic and cadmium were low in grain was East Africa.},

Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to demonstrate that more than 93{\%} of arsenite (As(iii)) and 95{\%} of arsenate (As(v)) were removed from a solution containing 200 microg As l(-1) within 60 minutes of exposure to a powder produced from dried roots. No difference in removal efficiency was observed between the two oxidation states of As studied. The amount of arsenic remaining in solution was found to be less than 10 microg l(-1) which is the WHO guideline limit value for As in drinking water. The presence of arsenic in drinking water in a number of countries in the developing world has been found to be much higher than the WHO level, affecting the health of millions of people. In this paper, we show that a biomaterial produced from dried water hyacinth roots, a plant that is found in abundant supply in many parts of the world, can provide a simple, effective and yet cheap method for removing arsenic from contaminated water.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate.DISCUSSION: The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach (DAGs) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated DAGs and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the DAG approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of DAGs, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view.SUMMARY: Using the simple 6-step DAG approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.},

	abstract = {Background Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are the priority heavy metals of major public health concern in industrialized countries. Exposure to them can cause cognitive impairment and depressive disorders through an effect on Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is an important biomarker of pregnancy. Despite a number of prior studies on heavy metals pollution, there is few of studies on the effect of heavy metals on BDNF during early pregnancy. This study aims to examine the association between maternal blood heavy metals concentrations and BDNF during the first trimester pregnancy among Myanmar migrants in Thailand. Methodology This cross sectional study, a part of ongoing birth cohort was conducted at the antenatal care clinic from June to October 2018. A total of 108 with Myanmar migrant pregnancy with a single viable fetus of 0 to 14 gestation weeks who stayed within the industrial plant at least 3 months before were recruited. Socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviors were accessed using a self-report questionnaire. Maternal blood heavy metals (lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As)) were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and plasma BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate binary logistic regression were modeled to access the association. Results Median (interquartile rank: IQR) concentrations were: BDNF (6.49 (1.79) $\mu$g/ml), Pb (2.77 (1.46) $\mu$g/dL), Hg (0.62 (0.54) $\mu$g/dL), Cd (0.93(0.86) $\mu$g/L) and As (0.40 (0.11) $\mu$g/dL) respectively. We categorized BDNF concentrations into high ({\textgreater} median) (n = 54) and low (. median) (n = 54) groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, high blood total arsenic concentration had 2.6-fold increased odds (aOR = 2.603, 95{\%} CI: 1.178, 5.751) of low plasma BDNF level as compared with low blood total arsenic group. However, there was no significant association between BDNF and Pb, Hg and Cd. Conclusions The present findings demonstrate higher blood total arsenic level were more likely to have lower BDNF in early pregnancy. Our study suggested that heavy metal could be worsen BDNF level which plays its important role on biological effect of maternal depressive disorder and newborn neurodevelopment.},

Rice bran is a byproduct of the rice milling process that has economic potential by virtue of highly nutritious rice bran oil contained within the bran. In this study, ohmic heating was used to stabilize rice bran and to improve rice bran oil extraction yield as compared to microwave heating and a control (no heating). Results showed that ohmic heating is an effective method for rice bran stabilization with moisture addition. Free fatty acid concentration increased more slowly than the control for raw bran samples subjected to ohmic heating with no corresponding temperature rise, indicating that electricity has a non-thermal effect on lipase activity. Ohmic heating increased the total percent of lipids extracted from rice bran to a maximum of 92{\%}, while 53{\%} of total lipids were extracted from the control samples. Lowering the frequency of alternating current significantly increased the amount of oil extracted, probably due to electroporation. Ohmic heating was successfully applied to rice bran despite its high oil content. This could have important implications for the enhanced extraction of non-polar constituents. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Compared with lung and bladder cancer, AMI mortality was the predominant cause of excess deaths during and immediately after the high-exposure period.

Cognitive abilities were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Chinese Revised (WISC-CR). Generalized linear models were performed to analyze associations of intelligence quotient (IQ) with trace element concentrations in cord blood and urinary trace element levels. General linear models were used to evaluate association between exposure fluctuation and children's IQ.

Metals were measured in 485 urine samples collected from mothers during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assessed the neuropsychological development of 553 4-year-olds with the McCarthy Scales of Childrens' Abilitites (MSCA), together with their ADHD symptomatology, using the ADHD-DSM-IV criteria. A total of 385 children were included in the present study. Results: We found no statistically significant associations between metals and general cognitive scale or executive function of the MSCA. We found negative coefficients for the exposure to cadmium 1st trimester, cadmium 3rd trimester and lead 3rd trimester on the general cognitive score of MSCA, although these results were not significant. We did not find any association between prenatal exposure to metals and ADHD symptomatology at the age of 4 years. Conclusions: Our results do not suggest that prenatal exposure to current low-levels of metals impairs children's cognitive development during preschool years. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a potent carcinogen, but there is a lack of information about cancer risk for concentrations {\textless} 100 $\mu$g/L in drinking water. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify skin cancer relative risks in relation to iAs exposure {\textless} 100 $\mu$g/L and the modifying effects of iAs metabolism. METHODS: The Arsenic Health Risk Assessment and Molecular Epidemiology (ASHRAM) study, a case-control study, was conducted in areas of Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia with reported presence of iAs in groundwater. Consecutively diagnosed cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin were histologically confirmed; controls were general surgery, orthopedic, and trauma patients who were frequency matched to cases by age, sex, and area of residence. Exposure indices were constructed based on information on iAs intake over the lifetime of participants. iAs metabolism status was classified based on urinary concentrations of methylarsonic acid (MA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Associations were estimated by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 529 cases with BCC and 540 controls were recruited for the study. BCC was positively associated with three indices of iAs exposure: peak daily iAs dose rate, cumulative iAs dose, and lifetime average water iAs concentration. The adjusted odds ratio per 10-$\mu$g/L increase in average lifetime water iAs concentration was 1.18 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.08, 1.28). The estimated effect of iAs on cancer was stronger in participants with urinary markers indicating incomplete metabolism of iAs: higher percentage of MA in urine or a lower percentage of DMA. CONCLUSION: We found a positive association between BCC and exposure to iAs through drinking water with concentrations {\textless} 100 $\mu$g/L.},

The total arsenic concentration was determined with an ICP-MS method. In this study, the inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice varied from 0.09 to 0.28mg/kg (n=8) and the total arsenic levels from 0.11 to 0.65mg/kg. There was a good correlation between the total and inorganic arsenic levels in long grain rice at a confidence level of 95{\%}. The total arsenic levels of rice-based baby foods were in the range 0.02 - 0.29mg/kg (n=10), however, the level of inorganic arsenic could only be quantitated in four samples, on average they were 0.11mg/kg. Our estimation of inorganic arsenic intake from long grain rice and rice-based baby food in Finland indicate that in every age group the intake is close to the lowest BMDL0.1 value 0.3$\mu$g/kg bw/day set by EFSA. According to our data, the intake of inorganic arsenic should be more extensively evaluated.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic is a potent human carcinogen and general toxicant. More than one hundred million people are exposed to elevated concentrations, mainly via drinking water, but also via industrial emissions. Arsenic is metabolized via methylation and reduction reactions, methylarsonic acid and dimethylarsinic acid being the main metabolites excreted in urine. Both inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites easily pass the placenta and both experimental and human studies have shown increased risk of impaired foetal growth and increased foetal loss. Recent studies indicate that prenatal arsenic exposure also increases the risk of adverse effects during early childhood. There is a growing body of evidence that the intrauterine or early childhood exposure to arsenic also induces changes that will become apparent much later in life. One epidemiological study indicated that exposure to arsenic in drinking water during early childhood or in utero was associated with an increased mortality in young adults from both malignant and non-malignant lung disease. Furthermore, a series of experimental animal studies provide strong support for late effects of arsenic, including various forms of cancer, following intrauterine arsenic exposure. The involved modes of action include epigenetic effects, mainly via DNA hypomethylation, endocrine effects (most classes of steroid hormones), immune suppression, neurotoxicity, and interaction with enzymes critical for foetal development and programming.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Body composition changes throughout life may explain the inconsistent associations reported between body mass index and lung function in children. Objectives: To assess the associations of body weight and composition trajectories from 7 to 15 years with lung function at 15 years and lung function growth between 8 and 15 years. Methods: Sex-specific body mass index, lean body mass index, and fat mass index trajectories were developed using Group-Based Trajectory Modeling on data collected at least twice between 7 and 15 years from 6,964 children (49{\%} boys) in the UK Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort. Associations of these trajectories with post-bronchodilation lung function parameters at 15 years and with lung function growth rates from 8 to 15 years were assessed using multivariable linear regression models, stratified by sex, in a subgroup with lung function data (n = 3,575). Measurements and Main Results: For all body mass measures we identified parallel trajectories that increased with age. There was no consistent evidence of an association between the body mass index trajectories and lung function measures. Higher lean body mass index trajectories were associated with higher levels and growth rates of FVC, FEV1, and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase in both sexes (e.g., boys in the highest lean body mass index trajectory had on average a 0.62 L [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.44-0.79; P trend{\textless}0.0001] higher FVCat 15 yr than boys in the lowest trajectory). Increasing fatmass index trajectories were associated with lower levels and growth rates of FEV1 and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase only in boys and lower levels of FEV1/FVC in both sexes. Conclusions: Higher lean body mass during childhood and adolescence is consistently associated with higher lung function at 15 years in both sexes, whereas higher fat mass is associated with lower levels of only some lung function parameters.},

In New Hampshire, detectable levels of arsenic have been reported in drinking water supplies throughout the state. Therefore, we have begun a population-based epidemiologic case-control study in which residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with primary squamous cell (n = 900) and basal cell (n = 1200) skin cancers are being selected from a special statewide skin cancer incidence survey; patients diagnosed with primary bladder cancers (n = 450) are being identified through the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry. Exposure histories of these patients will be compared to a control group of individuals randomly selected from population lists (n = 1200). Along with a detailed personal interview, arsenic and other trace elements are being measured in toenail clipping samples using instrumental neutron activation analysis. Household water samples are being tested on selected participants using a hydride generation technique with high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In the first 793 households tested arsenic concentrations ranged from undetectable (0.01 microgram/l) to 180 microgram/l. Over 10{\%} of the private wells contained levels above 10 microgram/l and 2.5{\%} were above 50 microgram/l. Based on our projected sample size, we expect at least 80{\%} power to detect a 2-fold risk of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or bladder cancer among individuals with the highest 5{\%} toenail concentrations of arsenic.},

	abstract = {The metalloid arsenic is a natural environmental contaminant to which humans are routinely exposed in food, water, air, and soil. Arsenic has a long history of use as a homicidal agent, but in the past 100 years arsenic, has been used as a pesticide, a chemotherapeutic agent and a constituent of consumer products. In some areas of the world, high levels of arsenic are naturally present in drinking water and are a toxicological concern. There are several structural forms and oxidation states of arsenic because it forms alloys with metals and covalent bonds with hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and other elements. Environmentally relevant forms of arsenic are inorganic and organic existing in the trivalent or pentavalent state. Metabolism of arsenic, catalyzed by arsenic (13 oxidation state) methyltransferase, is a sequential process of reduction from pentavalency to trivalency followed by oxidative methylation back to pentavalency. Trivalent arsenic is generally more toxicologically potent than pentavalent arsenic. Acute effects of arsenic range from gastrointestinal distress to death. Depending on the dose, chronic arsenic exposure may affect several major organ systems. A major concern of ingested arsenic is cancer, primarily of skin, bladder, and lung. The mode of action of arsenic for its disease endpoints is currently under study. Two key areas are the interaction of trivalent arsenicals with sulfur in proteins and the ability of arsenic to generate oxidative stress. With advances in technology and the recent development of animal models for arsenic carcinogenicity, understanding of the toxicology of arsenic will continue to improve.},

@article{Tseng2009,
	abstract = {Subjects exposed to arsenic show significant inter-individual variation in urinary patterns of arsenic metabolites but insignificant day-to-day intra-individual variation. The inter-individual variation in arsenic methylation can be partly responsible for the variation in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Wide inter-ethnic variation and family correlation in urinary arsenic profile suggest a genetic effect on arsenic metabolism. In this paper the environmental factors affecting arsenic metabolism are reviewed. Methylation capacity might reduce with increasing dosage of arsenic exposure. Furthermore, women, especially at pregnancy, have better methylation capacity than their men counterparts, probably due to the effect of estrogen. Children might have better methylation capacity than adults and age shows inconsistent relevance in adults. Smoking and alcohol consumption might be associated with a poorer methylation capacity. Nutritional status is important in the methylation capacity and folate may facilitate the methylation and excretion of arsenic. Besides, general health conditions and medications might influence the arsenic methylation capacity; and technical problems can cause biased estimates. The consumption of seafood, seaweed, rice and other food with high arsenic contents and the extent of cooking and arsenic-containing water used in food preparation may also interfere with the presentation of the urinary arsenic profile. Future studies are necessary to clarify the effects of the various arsenic metabolites including the trivalent methylated forms on the development of arsenic-induced human diseases with the consideration of the effects of confounding factors and the interactions with other effect modifiers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Toenail arsenic (As) concentrations were evaluated as a biomarker of inorganic As (As(in)) exposure in a population residing in an As-endemic region of Bangladesh. Drinking water and toenail samples were collected from 48 families (n = 223) every 3 months for 2 years and analyzed for As using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Drinking water collected 3, 6, and 9 months before each toenail sample collection was combined into a weighted lagged exposure variable. The contribution of each water sample to the measured toenail As concentration was estimated using maximum likelihood that accounted for fluctuations in drinking water exposure and toenail growth. The best model attributed 69{\%}, 14{\%}, and 17{\%} of the toenail As content to drinking water exposures that occurred 3, 6, and 9 months before toenail collection [95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI), 0.46-0.97, 0.00-0.31, and 0.03-0.35, respectively]. Generalized additive mixed models using penalized regression splines were employed to model the data. Below a drinking water concentration of 2 mug As/L, no relationship between drinking water As and toenail As concentrations was observed. Above this concentration, toenail As content increased in a dose-dependent fashion as drinking water As increased. Age was a significant effect modifier of drinking water As exposure on toenail As (beta = 0.01; 95{\%} CI, 0.002-0.02). Individuals possessing GSTT1-null genotypes had significantly more As in their toenails in contrast to GSTT1 wild-type individuals (beta = 0.11; 95{\%} CI, 0.06-0.2). Therefore, it seems that GSTT1 modifies the relationship between As(in) exposure and toenail As(in) content.},

Arsenic contamination of groundwater and soil is a major human health issue, particularly in South and Southeast Asia. Use of As-contaminated groundwater from shallow tube wells for irrigation of paddy rice, the staple food for people in this region, is one of the causes of As-related health impacts. The anaerobic growing conditions of flooded rice paddies and the unique physiology of the rice plants lead to increased As levels in rice. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set advisory levels of As in polished (i.e., white) rice grain at 0.2 mg/kg, but the EU and USA are yet to set legal standards for As in rice and rice-based products. Strategies for lowering As accumulation in rice revolve around two approaches---agronomic and biotechnological. Agronomic approaches, such as mineral supplementation of soil using iron, phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, water management, soil aeration practices, and the use of biological agents, are designed to lower As solubility, and uptake by rice. Rotation of the rice crop with As accumulating plants could also result in lowering soil As. Biotechnological approaches involve producing transgenic rice varieties by altering the expression of genes involved in As uptake, translocation, and sequestration in the plant. These approaches, combined with proper diet management and creating public awareness on potential health risks resulting from chronic exposure to As in rice, could play a key role in risk reduction.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of arsenic (As) exposure from drinking water on respiratory symptoms using data from the Health Effects of Arsenic Exposure Longitudinal Study (HEALS), a large prospective cohort study established in Ariahazar, Bangladesh in 2000-2002. A total of 7.31, 9.95 and 2.03{\%} of the 11 746 participants completing 4 years of active follow-up reported having a chronic cough, breathing problem or blood in their sputum, respectively, as assessed by trained physicians. Methods: Cox regression models were used to estimate HRs for respiratory symptoms during the follow-up period in relation to levels of chronic As exposure assessed at baseline, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, education and arsenic-related skin lesion status. Results: Significant positive associations were found between As exposure and respiratory symptoms. As compared with those with the lowest quintile of water As level (≤7 $\mu$g/l), the HRs for having respiratory symptoms were 1.27 (95{\%} CI 1.09 to 1.48), 1.39 (95{\%} CI 1.19 to 1.63), 1.43 (95{\%} CI 1.23 to 1.68) and 1.43 (95{\%} CI 1.22 to 1.68) for the second to fifth quintiles of baseline water As concentrations (7-40, 40-90, 90-178 and {\textgreater}178 $\mu$g/l), respectively. Similarly, the corresponding HRs in relation to the second to fifth quintiles of urinary arsenic were 1.10 (95{\%} CI 0.94 to 1.27), 1.11 (95{\%} CI 0.95 to 1.29), 1.29 (95{\%} CI 1.11 to 1.49) and 1.35 (95{\%} CI 1.16 to 1.56), respectively. These associations did not differ appreciably by cigarette smoking status. Conclusions: This prospective cohort study found a dose-response relationship between As exposure and clinical symptoms of respiratory diseases in Bangladesh. In particular, these adverse respiratory effects of As were clearly evident in the low to moderate dose range, suggesting that a large proportion of the country's population may be at risk of developing serious lung diseases in the future.},

	abstract = {Background Elevated body mass index (BMI) and arsenic are both associated with cancer and with non-malignant lung disease. Using a unique exposure situation in Northern Chile with data on lifetime arsenic exposure, we previously identified the first evidence of an interaction between arsenic and BMI for the development of lung cancer. Objectives We examined whether there was an interaction between arsenic and BMI for the development of non-malignant lung disease. Methods Data on lifetime arsenic exposure, respiratory symptoms, spirometry, BMI, and smoking were collected from 751 participants from cities in Northern Chile with varying levels of arsenic water concentrations. Spirometry values and respiratory symptoms were compared across subjects in different categories of arsenic exposure and BMI. Results Adults with both a BMI above the 90th percentile ({\textgreater}33.9 kg/m2) and arsenic water concentrations ≥11 µg/L exhibited high odds ratios (ORs) for cough (OR = 10.7, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 3.03, 50.1), shortness of breath (OR = 14.2, 95{\%} CI: 4.79, 52.4), wheeze (OR = 14.4, 95{\%} CI: 4.80, 53.7), and the combined presence of any respiratory symptom (OR = 9.82, 95{\%} CI: 4.22, 24.5). In subjects with lower BMIs, respiratory symptom ORs for arsenic water concentrations ≥11 µg/L were markedly lower. In never-smokers, reductions in forced vital capacity associated with arsenic increased as BMI increased. Analysis of the FEV1/FVC ratio in never-smokers significantly increased as BMI and arsenic concentrations increased. Similar trends were not observed for FEV1 alone or in ever-smokers. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that BMI may increase the risk for arsenic-related non-malignant respiratory disease.},

	abstract = {Differences in arsenic metabolism are known to play a role in individual variability in arsenic-induced disease susceptibility. Genetic variants in genes relevant to arsenic metabolism are considered to be partially responsible for the variation in arsenic metabolism. Specifically, variants in arsenic (3+ oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT), the key gene in the metabolism of arsenic, have been associated with increased arsenic methylation efficiency. Of particular interest is the fact that different studies have reported that several of the AS3MT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are in strong linkage-disequilibrium (LD), which also extends to a nearby gene, CYP17A1. In an effort to characterize the extent of the region in LD, we genotyped 46 SNPs in a 347 000 base region of chromosome 10 that included AS3MT in arsenic-exposed subjects from Mexico. Pairwise LD analysis showed strong LD for these polymorphisms, represented by a mean r2 of 0.82, spanning a region that includes five genes. Genetic association analysis with arsenic metabolism confirmed the previously observed association between AS3MT variants, including this large cluster of linked polymorphisms, and arsenic methylation efficiency. The existence of a large genomic region sharing strong LD with polymorphisms associated with arsenic metabolism presents a predicament because the observed phenotype cannot be unequivocally assigned to a single SNP or even a single gene. The results reported here should be carefully considered for future genomic association studies involving AS3MT and arsenic metabolism. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that inorganic arsenic, a major environmental pollutant, exerts immunosuppressive effects in epidemiological, in vitro, and animal models. The mechanisms, however, remain unclear, and little is known about variation in susceptibilities due to age and sex. We performed a review of the experimental and epidemiologic evidence on the association of arsenic exposure and immune diseases. The majority of the studies described arsenic as a potent immunosuppressive compound, though others have reported an increase in allergy and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that arsenic may also act as an immune system stimulator, depending on the dose or timing of exposure. Limited information, due to either the high concentrations of arsenic used in in vitro studies or the use of non-human data for predicting human risks, is available from experimental studies. Moreover, although there is emerging evidence that health effects of arsenic manifest differently between men and women, we found limited information on sex differences on the immunotoxic effects of arsenic. In conclusion, preliminary data show that chronic early-life exposure to arsenic might impair immune responses, potentially leading to increased risk of infections and inflammatory-like diseases during childhood and in adulthood. Further investigation to evaluate effects of arsenic exposure on the developing immune system of both sexes, particularly in human cells and using concentrations relevant to human exposure, should be a research priority.},

Methods: A total of 227 tap water samples were randomly collected from 67 municipalities in 11 provinces and the nine most frequently consumed bottled water brands were sampled to measure levels of nitrate, arsenic, nickel, chromium, cadmium, lead, selenium and zinc. Results: The median nitrate level was 4.2mg/l (range{\textless}1-29.0), with similar levels in rural and urban municipalities (p=0.86). Trace elements were unquantifiable in 94{\%} of tap water samples. Differences between areas were significant for nitrate (p{\textless}0.001) and arsenic (p=0.03). Only nitrate was quantifiable in bottled water (range 2.3-15.6mg/l). Conclusions: Nitrate levels in municipal water differed between regions and were below the regulatory limit in all samples, including bottled water. Trace element levels were low and mainly unquantifiable in tap and bottled water. ?? 2011 SESPAS.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines for drinking-water quality that cover biological and chemical hazards from both natural and anthropogenic sources. In the most recent edition of Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (2011), the WHO withdrew, suspended, did not establish, or raised guidelines for the inorganic toxic substances manganese, molybdenum, nitrite, aluminum, boron, nickel, uranium, mercury, and selenium. In this paper, we review these changes to the WHO drinking-water guidelines, examining in detail the material presented in the WHO background documents for each of these toxic substances. In some cases, these WHO background documents use literature reviews that do not take into account scientific research published within the last 10 or more years. In addition, there are instances in which standard WHO practices for deriving guidelines are not used; for example, rounding and other mathematical errors are made. According to published meeting reports from the WHO Chemical Aspects Working Group, the WHO has a timetable for revising some of its guidelines for drinking-water quality, but for many of these toxic substances the planned changes are minimal or will be delayed for as long as 5 years. Given the limited nature of the planned WHO revisions to the inorganic toxic substances and the extended timetable for these revisions, we suggest that governments, researchers, and other stakeholders might establish independent recommendations for inorganic toxic substances and possibly other chemicals to proactively protect public health, or at the very least, revert to previous editions of the Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, which were more protective of public health.},

	abstract = {Arsenic exposure has been associated with decreased club cell secretory protein (CC16) levels in adults. Further, both arsenic exposure and decreased levels of CC16 in childhood have been associated with decreased adult lung function. Our objective was to determine if urinary CC16 levels in children are associated with arsenic concentrations in environmental media collected from their homes. Yard soil, house dust, and tap water were taken from 34 homes. Urine and toenail samples were collected from 68 children. All concentrations were natural log-transformed prior to data analysis. There were associations between urinary CC16 and arsenic concentration in soil (b = -0.43, p = 0.001, R² = 0.08), water (b = -0.22, p = 0.07, R² = 0.03), house dust (b = -0.37, p = 0.07, R² = 0.04), and dust loading (b = -0.21, p = 0.04, R² = 0.04). In multiple analyses, only the concentration of arsenic in soil was associated with urinary CC16 levels (b = -0.42, p = 0.02, R² = 0.14 (full model)) after accounting for other factors. The association between urinary CC16 and soil arsenic may suggest that localized arsenic exposure in the lungs could damage the airway epithelium and predispose children for diminished lung function. Future work to assess this possible mechanism should examine potential associations between airborne arsenic exposures, CC16 levels, lung function, and other possible confounders in children in arsenic-impacted communities.},

	abstract = {Background: Observational studies on pubertal timing and asthma, mainly performed in females, have provided conflicting results about a possible association of early puberty with higher risk of adult asthma, possibly due to residual confounding. To overcome issues of confounding, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR), i.e., genetic variants were used as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of early puberty on post-pubertal asthma in both females and males. Methods and findings: MR analyses were performed in UK Biobank on 243,316 women using 254 genetic variants for age at menarche, and on 192,067 men using 46 variants for age at voice breaking. Age at menarche, recorded in years, was categorised as early ({\textless}12), normal (12--14), or late ({\textgreater}14); age at voice breaking was recorded and analysed as early (younger than average), normal (about average age), or late (older than average). In females, we found evidence for a causal effect of pubertal timing on asthma, with an 8{\%} increase in asthma risk for early menarche (odds ratio [OR] 1.08; 95{\%} CI 1.04 to 1.12; p = 8.7 × 10 −5 ) and an 8{\%} decrease for late menarche (OR 0.92; 95{\%} CI 0.89 to 0.97; p = 3.4 × 10 −4 ), suggesting a continuous protective effect of increasing age at puberty. In males, we found very similar estimates of causal effects, although with wider confidence intervals (early voice breaking: OR 1.07; 95{\%} CI 1.00 to 1.16; p = 0.06; late voice breaking: OR 0.93; 95{\%} CI 0.87 to 0.99; p = 0.03). We detected only modest pleiotropy, and our findings showed robustness when different methods to account for pleiotropy were applied. BMI may either introduce pleiotropy or lie on the causal pathway; secondary analyses excluding variants associated with BMI yielded similar results to those of the main analyses. Our study relies on self-reported exposures and outcomes, which may have particularly affected the power of the analyses on age at voice breaking. Conclusions: This large MR study provides evidence for a causal detrimental effect of early puberty on asthma, and does not support previous observational findings of a U-shaped relationship between pubertal timing and asthma. Common biological or psychological mechanisms associated with early puberty might explain the similarity of our results in females and males, but further research is needed to investigate this. Taken together with evidence for other detrimental effects of early puberty on health, our study emphasises the need to further investigate and address the causes of the secular shift towards earlier puberty observed worldwide.},

	abstract = {Dissimilatory As(V) (arsenate)-reducing bacteria may play an important role in arsenic release from anoxic sediments in the form of As(III) (arsenite). Although respiratory arsenate reductase genes (arrA) closely related to Geobacter species have been frequently detected in arsenic-rich sediments, it is still unclear whether they directly participate in arsenic release, mainly due to lack of pure cultures capable of arsenate reduction. In this study, we isolated a novel dissimilatory arsenate-reducing bacterium, strain OR-1, from Japanese paddy soil, and found that it was phylogenetically closely related to Geobacter pelophilus. OR-1 also utilized soluble Fe(III), ferrihydrite, nitrate, and fumarate as electron acceptors. OR-1 catalyzed dissolution of arsenic from arsenate-adsorbed ferrihydrite, while Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 did not. Furthermore, inoculation of washed cells of OR-1 into sterilized paddy soil successfully restored arsenic release. Arsenic K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis revealed that strain OR-1 reduced arsenate directly on the soil solid phase. Analysis of putative ArrA sequences from paddy soils suggested that Geobacter-related bacteria, including those closely related to OR-1, play an important role in arsenic release from paddy soils. Our results provide direct evidence for arsenic dissolution by Geobacter species and support the hypothesis that Geobacter species play a significant role in reduction and mobilization of arsenic in flooded soils and anoxic sediments.},

	abstract = {High levels of arsenic exposure have been associated with increases in cardiovascular disease risk. However, studies of arsenic's effects at lower exposure levels are limited and few prospective studies exist in the United States using long-term arsenic exposure biomarkers. We conducted a prospective analysis of the association between toenail arsenic and cardiovascular disease mortality using longitudinal data collected on 3939 participants in the New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study. Using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders, we estimated hazard ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals associated with the risk of death from any cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, in relation to natural-log transformed toenail arsenic concentrations. In this US population, although we observed no overall association, arsenic exposure measured from toenail clipping samples was related to an increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality among long-term smokers (as reported at baseline), with increased hazard ratios among individuals with ≥ 31 total smoking years (HR: 1.52, 95{\%} CI: 1.02, 2.27), ≥ 30 pack-years (HR: 1.66, 95{\%} CI: 1.12, 2.45), and among current smokers (HR: 1.69, 95{\%} CI: 1.04, 2.75). These results are consistent with evidence from more highly exposed populations suggesting a synergistic relationship between arsenic exposure and smoking on health outcomes and support a role for lower-level arsenic exposure in ischemic heart disease mortality.},

	abstract = {Exposure to elements in groundwater (toxic or beneficial) is commonplace yet, outside of lead and mercury, little research has examined the impact of many commonly occurring environmental exposures on mental abilities during the aging process. Inorganic arsenic is a known neurotoxin that has both neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive consequences. The aim of this study was to examine the potential association between current and long-term arsenic exposure and detailed neuropsychological functioning in a sample of rural-dwelling adults and elders. Data were analyzed from 434 participants (133 men and 301 women) of Project FRONTIER, a community-based participatory research study of the epidemiology of health issues of rural-dwelling adults and elders. The results of the study showed that GIS-based groundwater arsenic exposure (current and long-term) was significantly related to poorer scores in language, visuospatial skills, and executive functioning. Additionally, long-term low-level exposure to arsenic was significantly correlated to poorer scores in global cognition, processing speed and immediate memory. The finding of a correlation between arsenic and the domains of executive functioning and memory is of critical importance as these are cognitive domains that reflect the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Additional work is warranted given the population health implications associated with long-term low-level arsenic exposure.},

	abstract = {Spot urinary concentrations of environmental exposure biomarkers require correction for dilution. There is no consensus on the most appropriate method, with creatinine used by default despite lacking theoretical robustness. We comparatively assessed the efficacy of creatinine; specific gravity (SG); osmolality and modifications of all three for dilution correcting urinary arsenic. For 202 participants with urinary arsenic, creatinine, osmolality and SG measurements paired to drinking water As, we compared the performance corrections against two independent criteria: primarily, (A) correlations of corrected urinary As and the dilution measurements used to correct them - weak correlations indicating good performance and (B) correlations of corrected urinary As and drinking water As - strong correlations indicating good performance. More than a third of variation in spot urinary As concentrations was attributable to dilution. Conventional SG and osmolality correction removed significant dilution variation from As concentrations, whereas conventional creatinine over-corrected, and modifications of all three removed measurable dilution variation. Modified creatinine and both methods of SG and osmolality generated stronger correlations of urinary and drinking water As concentrations than conventional creatinine, which gave weaker correlations than uncorrected values. A disparity in optima between performance criteria was observed, with much smaller improvements possible for Criterion B relative to A. Conventional corrections -- particularly creatinine - limit the utility spot urine samples, whereas a modified technique outlined here may allow substantial improvement and can be readily retrospectively applied to existing datasets. More studies are needed to optimize urinary dilution correction methods. Covariates of urinary dilution measurements still warrant consideration.},

A study was conducted to compare the total As measurements from two analytical techniques: instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS), and to verify nails as an exposure biomarker in this population. In 1999, nail and water samples were collected in a pilot study. Fingernails and toenails were pooled from 32 participants and analysed for total As by both INAA and AFS. Mean nail As values were 14.8+/-2.4 and 19.4+/-2.8 microg g-1 (+/-SEM) for INAA and AFS, respectively. Results from these two methods were significantly correlated (r=0.93, p{\textless}0.0001). In 2000, a second study was conducted and INAA was used to measure total As in toenails from 314 Ba Men residents. Well water samples were collected from 121 households and analysed by AFS. A significant correlation was observed between toenail and well water As (r=0.84, p{\textless}0.0001). Based on the results, INAA was significantly correlated with AFS and proved to be a reliable measure of nail As levels. In this population, toenail samples are a useful internal As exposure biomarker from drinking water sources.},

In the study described in this article, 20 apple juices (or ciders), 15 apple-containing juices, one grape, and one citrus juice were analyzed for arsenic and lead.

Twelve samples (32{\%}) demonstrated arsenic levels nearly at or above the drinking water exposure limit of 10 parts per billion. No juices contained lead above drinking water exposure limits. Expanding drinking water limits to include juices (and other frequently consumed beverages) would better protect consumers while regular testing of these juices would better inform consumers of the risks posed by specific juices and brands.},

	abstract = {Objective: Describe the study design, data collection methods, 24-hour dietary recall protocol, and sample characteristics of the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2008. Design: A cross-sectional study designed to obtain information on the diets and feeding patterns of US infants, toddlers, and preschoolers ages birth to 47 months. Telephone interviews with parents and caregivers were conducted from June 2008 through January 2009 and included a household interview to recruit the household and collect information on household and child demographics and nutrition-related characteristics, and a dietary interview, including a 24-hour dietary recall collected using the 2008 Nutrition Data System for Research. A second dietary recall was collected on a random subsample to estimate usual nutrient intake distributions. Data collection instruments were built on those used in FITS 2002, with expanded survey content to address emerging issues in childhood nutrition and obesity. The dietary protocol was improved to increase reporting accuracy on portion sizes, and a bridging study was conducted to test effects of the changes in the food model booklet and protocol since FITS 2002 (n=240 cases aged 4 to 23 months). Subjects: A national random sample of 3,273 infants, toddlers, and preschoolers from birth up to age 4 years, with 2 days of dietary intake data for 701 cases. Results: Among sampled households with an age-eligible child, the response rate was 60{\%} for the recruitment interview. Of recruited households, the response rate for the dietary interview was 78{\%}. Conclusions: The FITS 2008 provides rigorous, well-tested methods and survey questions for nutrition researchers to use in other dietary studies of young children. FITS 2008 findings on the food and nutrient intakes of US children from birth up to age 4 years can inform dietetics practitioners, pediatric health practitioners, and policymakers about the dietary issues of young children. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Dietetic Association.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Arsenic is a natural component of the environment and is ubiquitous in soils, water, and the diet. Because dietary intake can be a significant source of background exposure to inorganic arsenic (the most toxicologically significant form), accurate intake estimates are needed to provide a context for risk management of arsenic exposure. Intake of inorganic arsenic by adults is fairly well characterized, but previous estimates of childhood intake were based on inorganic arsenic analyses in a limited number of foods (13 food types). This article estimates dietary intake for U.S. children (1 to 6 years of age) based on reported inorganic arsenic concentrations in 38 foods and in water used in cooking those foods (inorganic arsenic concentration of 0.8 ?g/L), and U.S. Department of Agriculture food consumption data. This information is combined using a probabilistic software model to extract food consumption patterns and compute exposure distributions. The mean childhood dietary intake estimate for inorganic arsenic was 3.2 ?g/day with a range of 1.6 to 6.2 ?g/day for the 10th and 95th percentiles, respectively. For both the mean and 95th percentile inorganic arsenic intake rates, intake was predominantly contributed by grain and grain products, fruits and fruit juices, rice and rice products, and milk.},

However, the quality of soil resources as defined by their potential impact on human health by propagation of harmful elements through the food chain has been poorly studied in Europe due to the lack of data of adequate detail and reliability. The European Union's first harmonized topsoil sampling and coherent analytical procedure produced trace element measurements from approximately 22,000 locations. This unique collection of information enables a reliable overview of the concentration of heavy metals, also referred to as metal(loid)s including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn, Sb. Co, and Ni. In this article we propose that in some cases (e.g. Hg and Cd) the high concentrations of soil heavy metal attributed to human activity can be detected at a regional level. While the immense majority of European agricultural land can be considered adequately safe for food production, an estimated 6.24{\%} or 137,000 km2 needs local assessment and eventual remediation action.},

	abstract = {A field survey was conducted in arsenic impacted and non-impacted paddies of Bangladesh to assess how arsenic levels in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain are related to soil and shoot concentrations. Ten field sites from an arsenic contaminated tubewell irrigation region (Faridpur) were compared to 10 field sites from a non-affected region (Gazipur). Analysis of the overall data set found that both grain and shoot total arsenic concentrations were highly correlated (P {\textless} 0.001) with soil arsenic. Median arsenic concentrations varied by 14, 10 and 3 fold for soil, shoot and grain respectively comparing the two regions. The reason for the sharp decline in the magnitude of difference between Gazipur and Faridpur for grain arsenic was due to an exponential decline in the grain/shoot arsenic concentration ratio with increasing shoot arsenic concentration. When the Bangladesh data were compared to EU and US soil-shoot-grain transfers, the same generic pattern could be found with the exception that arsenic was more efficiently transferred to grain from soil/shoot in the Bangladesh grown plants. This may reflect climatic or cultivar differences. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a carcinogen that contaminates drinking water worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that both exposure and genetic factors may influence susceptibility to arsenic-induced malignancies. We sought to identify novel susceptibility loci for arsenic-related bladder cancer in a US population with low to moderate drinking water levels of arsenic.We first screened a subset of bladder cancer cases using a panel of approximately 10,000 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Top ranking hits on the SNP array then were considered for further analysis in our population-based case-control study (n = 832 cases and 1,191 controls). SNPs in the fibrous sheath interacting protein 1 (FSIP1) gene (rs10152640) and the solute carrier family 39, member 2 (SLC39A2) in the ZIP gene family of metal transporters (rs2234636) were detected as potential hits in the initial scan and validated in the full case-control study. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the FSIP1 polymorphism was 2.57 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 5.85] for heterozygote variants (AG) and 12.20 (95{\%} CI 2.51, 59.30) for homozygote variants (GG) compared to homozygote wild types (AA) in the high arsenic group (greater than the 90th percentile), and unrelated in the low arsenic group (equal to or below the 90th percentile) (P for interaction = 0.002). For the SLC39A2 polymorphism, the adjusted ORs were 2.96 (95{\%} CI 1.23, 7.15) and 2.91 (95{\%} CI 1.00, 8.52) for heterozygote (TC) and homozygote (CC) variants compared to homozygote wild types (TT), respectively, and close to one in the low arsenic group (P for interaction = 0.03). Our findings suggest novel variants that may influence risk of arsenicassociated bladder cancer and those who may be at greatest risk from this widespread exposure. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

Except for cooking water, the amount of drinking water varied with season and appeared to be the major As source because the As concentration in water was generally correlated with the As concentration in urine, and they were related to lower IQ or SC (even after controlling for SES). The FFQ survey revealed that rice was consumed the most frequently (more than once daily), followed by daal (bean) soup and nonleafy vegetables, but fish, meat, and eggs were consumed approximately once a week. Water intake per meal from cooked rice was estimated to be 616 mL/person, followed by bean soup (258 mL/person) and cooked vegetables (82 mL/person).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that water used for cooking might be an important source of As, and the cooking process can affect the amount of As in cooked food.},

	abstract = {Both acute and chronic dehydration can have important implications for human behaviour and health. Young children, non-Autonomous individuals and the elderly are at a greater risk of dehydration. Mild hypertonic dehydration could be related to less efficient cognitive and physical performance and has been reported to be associated with frequently occurring pathological conditions, especially nephrolithiasis. The assessment of hydration status in a large sample appears to be of interest for conducting epidemiological and large clinical studies aimed at improving preventive and curative care. Especially in large-population studies, methods that are used have to be accurate, cheap, quick and require no technical expertise. Body weight change is widely used to determine acute hydration changes, but seems to be insufficiently accurate in longitudinal studies. Bioimpedance analysis methods enable the assessment of total body water content, but their use is still under debate. Because plasma osmolality directly reflects intracellular osmolality, it constitutes a good marker to assess acute hydration changes, but not chronic hydration status because it changes constantly. Moreover, venepuncture is considered to be invasive and is not suitable for a large-sample study, especially in children. Urinary markers appear to be good alternatives for assessing hydration status in large populations. Collection of urine samples is non-invasive and cheap. High technical expertise is not required to perform urinary marker measurements and these measurements can be carried out quickly. Thus, methods based on urinary markers are very well suited for field studies. Urine colour is probably the least sensitive marker despite its high specificity. Urine osmolality and especially urine specific gravity could be easily used for determining hydration status in large-sample studies.},

	abstract = {Arsenic exposure has been associated with low birth weight. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Alterations to metabolites may act as causal mediators of the effect of arsenic exposure on low birth weight. This pilot study aimed to explore the role of metabolites in mediating the association of arsenic exposure on infant birth weight. Study samples were selected from a well-established prospectively enrolled cohort in Bangladesh comprising 35 newborns and a subset of 20 matched mothers. Metabolomics profiling was performed on 35 cord blood samples and 20 maternal peripheral blood samples collected during the second trimester of pregnancy. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure was evaluated via cord blood samples and maternal toenail samples collected during the first trimester. Multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were used to explore the relationship between iAs exposure, metabolite alterations, and low birth weight. Cord blood arsenic level was correlated with elevated levels of 17-methylstearate, laurate (12:0) and 4-vinylphenol sulfate along with lower birth weight. Prenatal maternal toenail iAs level was associated with two peripheral blood metabolites (butyrylqlycine and tartarate), which likely contributed to higher cord blood iAs levels both independently and interactively. Findings of this pilot study indicate that both intrauterine and maternal peripheral blood metabolites appear to influence the toxic effect of inorganic arsenic exposure on low birth weight.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent studies in Bangladesh and elsewhere, exposure to arsenic (As) via drinking water is negatively associated with performance-related aspects of child intelligence (e.g., Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory) after adjustment for social factors. Because findings are not easily generalizable to the US, we examine this relation in a US population. METHODS: In 272 children in grades 3-5 from three Maine school districts, we examine associations between drinking water As (WAs) and intelligence (WISC-IV). RESULTS: On average, children had resided in their current home for 7.3 years (approximately 75{\%} of their lives). In unadjusted analyses, household well WAs is associated with decreased scores on most WISC-IV Indices. With adjustment for maternal IQ and education, HOME environment, school district and number of siblings, WAs remains significantly negatively associated with Full Scale IQ and Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Verbal Comprehension scores. Compared to those with WAs {\textless} 5 mug/L, exposure to WAs {\textgreater}/= 5 mug/L was associated with reductions of approximately 5-6 points in both Full Scale IQ (p {\textless} 0.01) and most Index scores (Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, Verbal Comprehension, all p's {\textless} 0.05). Both maternal IQ and education were associated with lower levels of WAs, possibly reflecting behaviors (e.g., water filters, residential choice) limiting exposure. Both WAs and maternal measures were associated with school district. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the association between WAs and child IQ raises the possibility that levels of WAs {\textgreater}/= 5 mug/L, levels that are not uncommon in the United States, pose a threat to child development.},

There is a chronic inflammation that leads to fixed narrowing of small airways and alveolar wall destruction (emphysema). This is characterised by increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils; and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of multiple inflammatory mediators (lipids, chemokines, cytokines, growth factors). A high level of oxidative stress may amplify this inflammation. There is also increased elastolysis and evidence for involvement of several elastolytic enzymes, including serine proteases, cathepsins and matrix metalloproteinases. The inflammation and proteolysis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an amplification of the normal inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. This inflammation, in marked contrast to asthma, appears to be resistant to corticosteroids, prompting a search for novel anti-inflammatory therapies that may prevent the relentless progression of the disease.},

Nail samples were measured for total As concentration by XRF and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Using concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), kappa, diagnostic sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp), and linear regression analyses, the concentration of As measured by XRF was compared to ICP-MS. The CCC peaked for scaled values of fingernail samples, at 0.424 (95{\%} CI: 0.065-0.784). The largest kappa value, 0.400 (95{\%} CI:  -0.282-1.000), was found at a 1.3 $\mu$g g(-1) cut-off concentration, for fingernails only, and the largest kappa at a clinically relevant cut-off concentration of 1.0 $\mu$g g(-1) was 0.237 (95{\%} CI:  -0.068-0.543), again in fingernails. Analyses generally showed excellent XRF Sn (up to 100{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 48-100{\%}), but low Sp (up to 30{\%} for the same analysis, 95{\%} CI: 14-50{\%}). Portable XRF shows some potential for use as a screening tool with fingernail samples. The difference between XRF and ICP-MS measurements decreased as sample mass increased to 30 mg. While this novel method of As detection in nails has shown relatively high agreement in some scenarios, this portable XRF is not currently considered suitable as a substitute for ICP-MS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fully understanding the determinants and sequelae of fetal growth requires a continuous measure of birth weight adjusted for gestational age. Published United States reference data, however, provide estimates only of the median and lowest and highest 5th and 10th percentiles for birth weight at each gestational age. The purpose of our analysis was to create more continuous reference measures of birth weight for gestational age for use in epidemiologic analyses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used data from the most recent nationwide United States Natality datasets to generate multiple reference percentiles of birth weight at each completed week of gestation from 22 through 44 weeks. Gestational age was determined from last menstrual period. We analyzed data from 6,690,717 singleton infants with recorded birth weight and sex born to United States resident mothers in 1999 and 2000.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Birth weight rose with greater gestational age, with increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling off beyond 40 weeks. Boys had higher birth weights than girls, later born children higher weights than firstborns, and infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers higher birth weights than those born to non-Hispanic black mothers. These results correspond well with previously published estimates reporting limited percentiles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our method provides comprehensive reference values of birth weight at 22 through 44 completed weeks of gestation, derived from broadly based nationwide data. Other approaches require assumptions of normality or of a functional relationship between gestational age and birth weight, which may not be appropriate. These data should prove useful for researchers investigating the predictors and outcomes of altered fetal growth.},

The mostly used lab-scale method to extract dietary fibre is not very efficient; dry fractionation is a more energy efficient alternative at larger scale. Three separation routes were studied: two-step electrostatic separation, sieving and a combination of electrostatic separation and sieving. All yielded fibre-enriched fractions with similar yield (20--21{\%}) and purity (67--68{\%} dm), which recovered 42--48{\%} of the fibre from original rice bran flour. The enriched fraction obtained by two-step electrostatic separation contained more small particles and possibly different DF composition compared to the other two, which resulted in different functional properties. Compared to dietary fibre extracted by enzymatic-gravimetric method, enriched fractions by dry fractionation have a similar water retention capacity and oil bind capacity. This suggests that fibre-enriched fractions by dry fractionation can be applied in foods and provide similar technological and physiological properties as wet-extracted dietary fibre does.},

	abstract = {Objective: We studied the associations between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and the neurobehavioral status in two population-based birth cohorts. Methods: Children (n=467) were assessed by psychologists and teachers for neuropsychological functioning (McCarthy Scales, MCSA), inattention-hyperactivity symptoms (ADHD-DSM-IV form list) and social behavior (California Preschool Social Competence Scale, CPSCS). Regression models were used with covariate adjustment. Results: Sixteen percent of children had ADHD-DSM-IV symptoms. MCSA scores were linearly associated with ADHD symptom scores (general cognitive Beta. =-0.6 [-1.0; -0.3] per symptom), specifically inattention scores (general cognitive Beta. =-1.8 [-2.3; -1.2]). CPSCS scores were associated with ADHD symptoms (Beta. =-2.19 [-2.5; -1.9]). MCSA scores of executive function, perceptive-performance and quantitative sub-areas had stronger associations with ADHD symptoms. Conclusions: Preschooler ADHD symptoms are associated with concurrent decrements in neurocognitive and social competence functioning. The association patterns are similar to those found in older children with ADHD symptomology (Marks et al., 2005 [36], Seidman, 2006 [46], Sonuga-Barke et al., 2003 [48], Yochman et al., 2006 [53]). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

Certified reference materials (CRM) DOLT-4 (Dogfish Liver) and TORT-2 (Lobster Hepatopancreas), and a commercial herring fish meal were evaluated. All experimental work described here was carried out by the same operator using the same instrumentation, thus eliminating possible differences in results caused by laboratory related factors. Low concentrations of iAs were found in CRM DOLT-4 (0.012 $\pm$ 0.003 mg kg-1) and the herring fish meal sample (0.007 $\pm$ 0.002 mg kg-1) for all extraction methods. When comparing the concentration of iAs in CRM TORT-2 found in this study and in the literature dilute acids, HNO3 and HCl, showed the highest extracted iAs wheras dilute NaOH (in 50{\%} ethanol) showed significantly lower extracted iAs. However, most other extraction solvents were not statistically different from one another. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of fetal growth and body proportionality have been based on error-prone gestational age estimates and on inappropriate comparisons of infants with dissimilar birth weights. Based on a cohort of 8719 infants with validated (by early ultrasonography) gestational ages and indexes of body proportionality standardized for birth weight, potential maternal and fetal determinants of fetal growth and proportionality were assessed. Maternal history of previous low birth weight infants, pregnancy-related hypertension (particularly if severe), diabetes, prepregnancy weight, net gestational weight gain, cigarette smoking, height, parity, and fetal sex were all significantly associated with fetal growth in the expected directions. Consistent with previous reports, maternal age, marital status, and onset or total amount of prenatal care had no significant independent effects. Fetal growth ratio (relative weight for gestational age), pregnancy-related hypertension, fetal sex, and maternal height were the only significant determinants of proportionality. Infants who were growth-retarded, those with taller mothers, those whose mothers had severe pregnancy-related hypertension, and males tended to be longer and thinner and had larger heads for their weight, although these variables explained only a small fraction of the variance in the proportionality measures. Among infants with intrauterine growth retardation, gestational age was not independently associated with proportionality (in particular, late term and post-term infants did not tend to be more disproportional), a finding that does not support the hypothesis that earlier onset of growth retardation leads to more proportional growth retardation. The results raise serious questions about previous studies of proportionality, particularly those suggesting a nutritional etiology for proportional intrauterine growth retardation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

It remains unclear whether these compounds can also impact on lung function. We assessed the association between prenatal exposure to OCs and lung function during childhood. Methods: We included 1308 mother-child pairs enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Prenatal concentrations of p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [p,p′-DDT], p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [p,p′-DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and seven polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs] were measured in cord blood. Spirometry was performed in the offspring at ages 4 (n = 636) and 7 years (n = 1192). Results: More than 80{\%} of samples presented quantifiable levels of p,p′-DDE, HCB, PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180; p,p′-DDE was the compound with the highest median concentrations. At 4 years, prenatal p,p′-DDE exposure was associated with a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in all quartiles of exposure (e.g., third quartile [0.23--0.34 ng/mL]: $\beta$ for FEV1 −53.61 mL, 95{\%} CI −89.87, −17.35, vs. the lowest). Prenatal p,p′-DDE levels also decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC, but associations did not reach statistical significance in most exposure quartiles. At 7 years, p,p′-DDE was associated with a decrease in FVC and FEV1 in only the second quartile of exposure (e.g. $\beta$ for FEV1 −36.96 mL, 95{\%} CI −66.22, −7.70, vs. the lowest). Prenatal exposure to HCB was associated with decreased FVC and FEV1, but in only the second quartile and at 7 years (e.g. [0.07--0.14 ng/mL]: $\beta$ for FEV1 −25.79 mL, 95{\%} CI −55.98, 4.39, vs. the lowest). PCBs were not consistently associated with lung function. Conclusion: Prenatal exposure to p,p′-DDE may decrease lung function during childhood, especially FEV1 and at medium levels of exposure. Further and deeper knowledge on the impact of environmental chemicals during pregnancy on lung development is needed.},

Drinking water and toenail samples were collected during a home visit and analyzed for arsenic and other elements. Participants reported dietary supplement intake habits and provided demographic data. Arsenic concentrations of drinking water and toenail samples were positively correlated. Of the nutritional measures evaluated, toenail iron concentration was a significant modifier of the exposure-biomarker association. No demographic characteristics or general measures of dietary intake affected the biomarker response. The results presented herein are critical for biomarker validation and prove promising for sound application of the arsenic toenail biomarker to future epidemiological investigations.},

The present study is aimed to determine the urine concentrations of Co in four years-old children in the INMA-Asturias cohort (Spain) and to assess the factors determining the observed levels. This cohort is located in a heavily industrialized zone with strong potential for metal exposure. Some diet components such as consumption of sweets were meaningfully associated with higher urine Co concentrations. Traffic pollution also showed a noteworthy positive association with Co levels. Family tobacco consumption did not show substantial association with the urine concentrations of this metal in the INMA-Asturias children. A significant inverse association between urine Co and venous blood ferritin was found. Iron deficiency anemic children had significantly higher concentrations of Co than those with normal levels, e.g. median values 1.9 $\mu$g/g creatinine and 1.0 $\mu$g/g creatinine, respectively. This association could be explained by an increased expression of DMT1, a divalent metal transporter that captures higher levels of iron in deficiency states of this metal. This transporter is non-specific and not only captures iron but also other divalent metals such as Co. The presence of this metal in iron deficiency anemic children may represent an additional disturbing health factor that must be considered during treatment.},

Although the disease becomes clinically apparent around the age of 40-50 years, its origins can begin very early in life. Different risk factors in very early life - ie, in utero and during early childhood - drive the development of clinically apparent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in later life. In discussions of which risk factors drive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it is important to realise that the disease is very heterogeneous and at present is largely diagnosed by lung function only. In this Review, we will discuss the evidence for risk factors for the various phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during different stages of life.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is recognized as a carcinogen for human skin, bladder, and lung, following either ingestion or inhalation; however the exact mode of action of environmentally relevant exposure has not been determined. Because arsenic in the environment exists in several oxidative states and can interact with thiols, it is thought that arsenic toxicity is mediated through oxidative stress. Production of oxygen radicals following acute in vitro exposures has been demonstrated. However, our research has chosen to focus on the role of oxidative stress following whole animal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of arsenic. Following a 28-d inhalation of arsenic or cigarette smoke or both, there was a significant decrease in both the reduced and total glutathione levels in the combined arsenic and smoke group compared to groups exposed to arsenic or smoke alone. This correlated with a 5-fold increase in DNA oxidation. Lungs processed for immunohistochemistry localization of 8-oxo-dG showed increased staining in nuclei of airway epithelium and subadjacent interstitial cells. Increases in DNA oxidation were not due to increased inflammation. Although inhalation of arsenic is an important occupational exposure, the majority of human exposures occurs through ingestion of arsenic. Our recent work has been devoted to the identification of altered pulmonary gene and protein expression following ingestion of environmentally relevant levels of arsenic in drinking water. We have found that, following chronic exposure, arsenic leads to misregulation of a number of genes and proteins in the lung. A large percentage of the altered genes and proteins are known to be regulated by redox-sensitive transcription factors, (SP1, NF $\kappa$B, AP-1), suggesting that, at environmentally relevant levels of chronic exposure, arsenic may be acting through alteration of cellular redox status. Validation of the alterations seen in animal models of exposure is being carried out in humans. Copyright {\textcopyright} Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract = {Abstract Metals are ubiquitous in nature, being found in all environmental compartments, and have a variety of applications in human activities. Metals are transferred by maternal blood to the fetus via the placenta, and exposure continues throughout life. For the general population, exposure comes mainly from water and food consumption, including breast milk. In this paper, we reviewed studies on the toxicity of arsenic, lead, mercury and cadmium, the toxic metals of most concern to human health, focusing on the potential risks to newborns and infants. A total of 75 studies published since 2000 reporting the levels of these metals in breast milk were reviewed. Lead was the metal most investigated in breast milk (43 studies), and for which the highest levels were reported (up to 1515 µg/L). Arsenic was the least investigated (18 studies), with higher levels reported for breast milk (up to 149 µg/L) collected in regions with high arsenic concentrations in water ({\textgreater}10 µg/L). Data from 34 studies on mercury showed that levels in breast milk were generally higher in populations with high fish consumption, where it may be present mainly as MeHg. Cadmium levels in breast milk were the lowest, with means {\textless}2 µg/L in most of the 29 studies reviewed. Results of risk assessments indicated that the intake of arsenic, lead and mercury by infants through breastfeeding can be considered a health concern in most regions of the world. Although the potential risks to infants are mostly outweighed by the benefits of breast milk consumption, it is essential that contaminants be continuously monitored, especially in the most critical regions, and that measures be implemented by health authorities to reduce exposure of newborns and infants to these metals, and thus avoid unnecessary health risks. },

	abstract = {About 100 million rural people in Asia are exposed to arsenic (As)-polluted drinking water and agricultural products. Total and inorganic arsenic (t-As and i-As) intake mainly depend on the quality of drinking and cooking waters, and amounts of seafood and rice consumed. The main problems occur in countries with poor water quality where the population depends on rice for their diet, and their t-As and i-As intake is high as a result of growing and cooking rice in contaminated water. Workable solutions to remove As from water and breeding rice cultivars with low As accumulation are being sought. In the meantime, simple recommendations for processing and cooking foods will help to reduce As intake. For instance, cooking using high volumes of As-free water may be a cheap way of reducing As exposure in rural populations. It is necessary to consider the effects of cooking and processing on t-As and i-As to obtain a realistic view of the risks associated with intake of As in As-endemic areas.},

@article{Jackson2012,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) exposure to humans is pervasive, and, increasingly, studies are revealing adverse health effects at ever lower doses. Drinking water is the main route of exposure for many individuals; however, food can be a significant source of As to individuals, especially if their diet is rice-based. Infants are particularly susceptible to dietary exposure, since many first foods contain rice and infants have a low body mass. Here we report on As concentration and speciation in infant formulas and first foods. Speciation is essential for food analysis because of the much greater toxicity of inorganic As species and the possibility that As in food (unlike water) may be present in either inorganic or organic forms. Infant milk formulas were low in total As (2.2-12.6 ng g(-1), n = 15). Non-dairy formulas were significantly higher in As than dairy-based formulas. Arsenic in formula was almost exclusively inorganic. Arsenic concentration in purees (n = 41) and stage 2/3 foods (n = 18) ranged from 0.3 to 22 ng g(-1). Rice-fortified foods had significantly higher total As concentrations than non-rice-based foods. Again, As speciation was predominantly inorganic with lower concentrations of dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) also present. These data confirm that infants are exposed to As via diet, and suggest that careful attention to diet choices may limit this exposure.},

@article{Eglen2009a,
	abstract = {The name R refers to the computa- tional environment initially created by Robert Gentleman and Robert Ihaka, similar in nature to the S statistical environment developed at Bell Laborato- ries (http://www.r-project.org/about. html) 1. It has since been developed and maintained by a strong team of core developers (R-core), who are renowned researchers in computational disciplines. R has gained wide acceptance as a reliable and powerful modern computational en- vironment for statistical computing and visualisation, and is now used in many areas of scientific computation. R is free software, released under the GNU Gen- eral Public License; this means anyone can see all its source code, and there are no restrictive, costly licensing arrangements. One of the main reasons that computa- tional biologists use R is the Bioconductor project which is a set of packages for R to analyse genomic data. These packages have, in many cases, been provided by researchers to complement descriptions of algorithms in journal articles. Many computational biologists regard R and Bioconductor as fundamental tools for their research. R is a modern, functional programming lan- guage that allows for rapid development of ideas, together with object-oriented features for rigorous software develop- ment. The rich set of inbuilt functions makes it ideal for high-volume analysis or statistical simulations, and the packaging system means that code provided by others can easily be shared. Finally, it generates high-quality graphical output so that all stages of a study, from modelling/analysis to publication, can be undertaken within R. For detailed discussion of the merits of R in computational biology, see 2. How to Teach R to Students This brief article is an introduction to teaching R, based on my experience in teaching computational biology graduate students. R is a powerful environment for teaching many aspects of computational biology, including functional genomics, computational neuroscience, dynamical sys- tems, statistical genetics, and network biol- ogy. I provide resources and suggestions for teachingRand describe common difficulties faced by students when learning R.},

	abstract = {Background: Cadmium, as measured in human tissue, has been associated with numerous health outcomes. However, few studies have evaluated the reliability of cadmium measurements across different biologic samples. We evaluated toenail cadmium levels over time and compared toenail cadmium to urinary cadmium. We also evaluated the relationship between biomarker concentrations and cigarette smoking, a known source of cadmium exposure. Methods: Cadmium was assessed in urine and toenail samples collected from 1338 pregnant women participating in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Each participant was asked to provide a urine and a toenail sample at enrollment (between 24 and 28 weeks gestation) and another toenail sample 2--8 weeks postpartum. Cadmium concentrations were determined using inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Spearman correlations were assessed for cadmium in the toenails across the two-time points and comparing toenail and urine levels. Smoking status was evaluated as a predictor of cadmium levels. Results: Toenail cadmium assessed during pregnancy and postpartum were modestly correlated (R = 0.3, p {\textless} 0.0001). However, urine and toenail cadmium levels were unrelated (R = −0.03, p = 0.46). Both toenail and urinary cadmium levels were associated with women's smoking status. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that both toenail and urinary cadmium concentrations reflect the major source of exposure -- cigarette smoking. Toenail cadmium concentrations are modestly reproducible pre- and postpartum; but do not appear to be related to urinary cadmium and thus likely represent different windows and chronicity of exposure among pregnant women.},

Expression of KCNA5, which encodes a potassium ion channel protein, was positively associated with water and toe nail arsenic levels. Expression of 2 and 11 genes were positively associated with nail and urinary arsenic, respectively. Because arsenic exposure has been reported to be associated with long QT intervals and vascular disease in humans, we also used this TLDA for analysis of gene expression in human cardiomyocytes exposed to arsenic in vitro. Expression of the ion-channel genes CACNA1, KCNH2, KCNQ1 and KCNE1 were down-regulated by 1-$\mu$M arsenic. Alteration of some common pathways, including those involved in oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling, and ion-channel function, may underlay the seemingly disparate array of arsenic-associated diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.},

	abstract = {Arsenic contaminations have been evaluated in rice grains from Hunan Province, China. Forty-three locally grown rice samples were collected from 40 counties. Arsenic species including As(III), As(V), MMA and DMA were separated and determined by HPLC-ICP-MS method. The mean concentration of total arsenic in rice samples was 129.4 $\pm$ 49.2 $\mu$g/kg, lower than the Chinese maximum contaminant levels of inorganic arsenic in rice (200 $\mu$g/kg). The dominant species detected in rice samples was As(III), following DMA, As(V) and MMA. The Pearson's correlation analysis indicated significant positive relationships between As(III) and total arsenic (r = 0.939, p {\textless} 0.01), and DMA and total arsenic (r = 0.761, p {\textless} 0.01). However, the percentage of As(III) decreased with the total arsenic concentration in rice (r = -. 0.515, p {\textless} 0.01). Spatial distribution map of total arsenic concentration in rice samples from Hunan Province was obtained using kriging interpolation. High levels of total arsenic in rice grains were observed in south and east regions associated with mining activities and urbanization process. The cancer risk and hazard quotient were employed to estimate the potential human health risk. The results suggested great carcinogenic risk and high potential non-carcinogenic risk to people consuming local rice in Hunan Province.},

The analyses were performed in raw rice and in rice cooked by boiling to dryness in water spiked with As(V) (0.1-1 microg mL(-1)). In raw rice, inorganic As represented 27-93{\%} of total As: total As = 0.188 +/- 0.078 microg g(-1) dry weight (dw); inorganic As = 0.114 +/- 0.046 microg g(-1) dw. After cooking, the rice retained between 45{\%} and 107{\%} of the As(V) added to the cooking water, and the inorganic As concentrations ranged between 0.428 microg g(-1) dw (0.1 microg mL(-1) in the cooking water) and 3.89 microg g(-1) dw (1.0 microg microL(-1) in the cooking water). For raw rice, the inorganic As intake of the Spanish population (16 g raw rice/day) remains below the tolerable daily intake (TDI) proposed by the WHO (2.1 microg inorganic As/day/kg body weight). In rice cooked with water contaminated with As(V), this cereal intake is sufficient to attain the TDI. The results reveal the need to consider the determination of inorganic As and the influence of cooking when evaluating the risks associated with the consumption of rice.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with pregnancy complications and reduced fetal growth in populations where total arsenic exposure exceeds 50 $\mu$g/L. However, the potential effect on pregnancy outcomes remains unclear at lower levels of arsenic exposure, such as those most commonly observed in the United States. Objectives: We evaluated the associations between arsenic exposure during pregnancy with fetal growth and risk of pregnancy complications using data from mother-infant pairs participating in the National Children's Study. Methods: Prenatal arsenic exposure was measured using maternal urine collected during the third trimester. Information about pregnancy complications was abstracted from medical records. Fetal growth, including gestational age, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and ponderal index, was ascertained through physical measurement at birth and extracted from medical records. Results: Medians [interquartile range (IQR)] of maternal urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were 7.77 $\mu$g/L (7.98) and 3.44 $\mu$g/L (3.13), respectively. Each increase in IQR of prenatal total arsenic level was associated with greater birth length (+0.28 cm; 95{\%} CI: 0.14, 0.42), greater head circumference (+0.12 cm; 95{\%} CI: 0.04, 0.21), and lower ponderal index (−0.37 kg/m3; 95{\%} CI: −0.58, −0.17). Similar results were obtained for levels of prenatal DMA. Tests for multiplicative interaction indicate that prenatal urinary DMA was negatively associated with gestational age among female infants (−0.44 week decrease in gestational age estimated for each IQR increase in DMA; 95{\%} CI: −0.84, −0.05), while no association was observed among male infants (pinteraction = 0.02). No significant associations were detected between arsenic and birth weight or pregnancy complications. Conclusions: Higher prenatal arsenic exposure was associated with longer birth length, greater head circumference, and lower ponderal index. Associations between arsenic and gestational age may be modified by infant sex.},

	abstract = {This study examined 2,006 pregnant women chronically exposed to a range of  naturally-occurring concentrations of arsenic in drinking-water in three upazilas in Bangladesh to find out relationships between arsenic exposure and selected reproductive health outcomes. While there was a small but statistically significant association between arsenic exposure and birth-defects (odds ratio=1.005, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.001-1.010), other outcomes, such as stillbirth, low birth-weight, childhood stunting, and childhood under-weight, were not associated with arsenic exposure. It is possible that the association between arsenic exposure from drinking-water and birth-defects may be a statistical anomaly due to the small number of birth-defects observed. Future studies should look more closely at birth-defects, especially neural tube defects, to elucidate any potential health effects associated with arsenic exposure from drinking-water. Further, given the knowledge that serious health effects can result from chronic arsenic exposure, efforts to find alternatives of safe drinking-water for the population must continue.},

	abstract = {Accurate quantitation of any contaminant of interest is critical for exposure assessment and metabolism studies that support risk assessment. A preliminary step in an arsenic exposure assessment study in Nevada quantified total arsenic (TAs) concentrations in tissues as biomarkers of exposure. Participants in this study ( n = 95) were at least 45 years old, had lived in the area for more than 20 years, and were exposed to a wide range of arsenic concentrations in drinking water (3-2100 ppb). Concentrations of TAs in blood, urine, and toenails determined by hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HG-AFS) ranged from below detection to 0.03, 0.76, and 12 ppm, respectively; TAs in blood rarely exceeded the limit of detection. For comparison, TAs in toenails determined by neutron activation analysis (NAA) ranged from below detection to 16 ppm. Significant ( P {\textless} 0.0001) positive regressions were seen between the TAs concentration in toenails and in drinking water (adjusted r2= 0.3557 HG-AFS, adjusted r2= 0.3922 NAA); TAs concentrations in urine were not described by drinking water As (adjusted r2= 0.0170, P = 0.1369). Analyses of TAs in toenails by HGAFS and NAA yielded highly concordant estimates ( r = 0.7977, P {\textless} 0.0001). These results suggest that toenails are a better biomarker of chronic As exposure than urine in the current study, because the sequestration of As in toenails provides an integration of exposure over time that does not occur in urine. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Rice is unique among the world's major food crops by virtue of the extent and variety of its uses and its adaptability to a broad range of climatic, edaphic, and cultural conditions. It is usually grown under shallow flood or "wet paddy" conditions but is also cultured where floodwaters may be several meters deep and, at the opposite extreme, as an upland cereal. Although rice appears to have a high water requirement, its requirement is actually not much different from that of other field crops. Unlike most cereal crops, however, rice benefits from standing water. It is capable of anaerobic respiration and has aerenchyma tissue in the aerial organs through which oxygen diffuses to the roots. Its unique ability to grow and produce high caloric food values per unit area on all types ofland and water regimes, combined with its adaptation to a wide variety of climates and agricultural conditions, make rice the world's most important cereal crop. Thousands of cultivars are grown throughout the world, representing a wide range of plant and grain characteristics. The crop was planted on some 144,641,000 ha of land (1985-87) which produced 468,275,000 metric tons of rice with an average world yield of 3.2 t/ha. The significance of rice is shown in its widespread use as a staple food by more than half of the world's population. Millions of people in Asia subsist almost entirely on rice. Most countries rely almost entirely on domestic production to feed their populations, with only about 103 B. S. Luh (ed.), Rice},

	abstract = {Background: Heavy metals are widely distributed in the environment. Recent reports have demonstrated the risk of preterm birth following heavy metal exposure. Preterm births are classified as early and late, depending on the duration of pregnancy, and are associated with increased risk of congenital illnesses such as heart failure, asthma, etc. Particularly, early preterm births carry a higher risk of mortality; however, the differential effects of heavy metal exposure on early and late preterm births are unknown. Objectives: To analyze the association between maternal whole blood concentrations of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and manganese (Mn) that are common toxicants in Japan, and early and late preterm births. Methods: The data of 14,847 pregnant women who were participants of the Japan Environment and Children's Study were used. Data of the self-questionnaire pertaining to the first trimester (T1), second/third trimester (T2), and medical records after delivery were analyzed. We divided preterm birth into two groups: early preterm (22 to {\textless} 34 weeks) and late preterm (34 to {\textless} 37 weeks). Maternal blood samples for measuring heavy metal concentrations were collected in T2 (pregnancy weeks: 14--39). The participants were classified into four quartiles (Q1--Q4) according to increasing heavy metal levels. Results: The rate of preterm birth was 4.5{\%}. After controlling for confounding factors, such as age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, partner's smoking, drinking habits, gravidity, parity, number of cesarean deliveries, uterine infections, household income, educational levels, and sex of infant, Cd levels were found, by multivariable logistic regression analysis, to be significantly associated with early preterm birth (p = 0.002), with odds ratio for early preterm birth of 1.91 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.12--3.27, P = 0.018) in subjects of Q4 compared with in subjects with term birth (≧ 37 weeks). Conclusion: Maternal blood Cd levels during pregnancy are positively associated with the risk of early preterm birth among Japanese women. Identification of the main source of maternal Cd exposure may contribute to the prevention of early preterm births and health maintenance of mothers and their infants in the future.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic(As) is metabolized through a series of methylation reactions catalyzed by arsenic(III)-methyltransferase (AS3MT), resulting in the generation of monomethylarsonic (MMAs) and dimethylarsinic acids (DMAs). AS3MT activity requires the presence of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, a product of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, and a reductant. Although glutathione (GSH), the primary endogenous antioxidant, is not required for As methylation, GSH stimulates As methylation rates in vitro. However, the relationship between GSH redox and As methylation capacity in humans is unknown. We wished to test the hypothesis that a more oxidized plasma GSH redox status is associated with decreased As methylation capacity and examine whether these associations are modified by folate nutritional status. Concentrations of plasma GSH and GSSG, plasma folate, total blood As (bAs), total urinary As (uAs), and uAs metabolites were assessed in a cross-sectional study of n=376 Bangladeshi adults who were chronically exposed to As in drinking water. We observed that a decreased plasma GSH/GSSG ratio (reflecting a more oxidized redox state) was significantly associated with increased urinary {\%}MMA, decreased urinary {\%}DMA, and increased total bAs in folate-deficient individuals (plasma folate ≤9.0 nmol/L). Concentrations of plasma GSH and GSSG were independently associated with increased and decreased As methylation capacity, respectively. No significant associations were observed in folate-sufficient individuals, and interactions by folate status were statistically significant. Our findings suggest that GSH/GSSG redox regulation might contribute to the large interindividual variation in As methylation capacity observed in human populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Well-known high-As groundwater areas have been found in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, China and Hungary, and more recently in West Bengal (India), Bangladesh and Vietnam. The scale of the problem in terms of population exposed to high As concentrations is greatest in the Bengal Basin with more than 40 million people drinking water containing 'excessive' As. These large-scale 'natural' As groundwater problem areas tend to be found in two types of environment: firstly, inland or closed basins in arid or semi-arid areas, and secondly, strongly reducing aquifers often derived from alluvium. Both environments tend to contain geologically young sediments and to be in flat, low-lying areas where groundwater flow is sluggish. Historically, these are poorly flushed aquifers and any As released from the sediments following burial has been able to accumulate in the groundwater. Arsenic-rich groundwaters are also found in geothermal areas and, on a more localised scale, in areas of mining activity and where oxidation of sulphide minerals has occurred. The As content of the aquifer materials in major problem aquifers does not appear to be exceptionally high, being normally in the range 1-20 mg kg
                        -1. There appear to be two distinct 'triggers' that can lead to the release of As on a large scale. The first is the development of high pH ({\textgreater}8.5) conditions in semi-arid or arid environments usually as a result of the combined effects of mineral weathering and high evaporation rates. This pH change leads either to the desorption of adsorbed As (especially As(V) species) and a range of other anion-forming elements (V, B, F, Mo, Se and U) from mineral oxides, especially Fe oxides, or it prevents them from being adsorbed. The second trigger is the development of strongly reducing conditions at near-neutral pH values, leading to the desorption of As from mineral oxides and to the reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides, also leading to As release. Iron (II) and As(III) are relatively abundant in these groundwaters and SO
                        4 concentrations are small (typically 1 mg l
                        -1 or less). Large concentrations of phosphate, bicarbonate, silicate and possibly organic matter can enhance the desorption of As because of competition for adsorption sites. A characteristic feature of high groundwater As areas is the large degree of spatial variability in As concentrations in the groundwaters. This means that it may be difficult, or impossible, to predict reliably the likely concentration of As in a particular well from the results of neighbouring wells and means that there is little alternative but to analyse each well. Arsenic-affected aquifers are restricted to certain environments and appear to be the exception rather than the rule. In most aquifers, the majority of wells are likely to be unaffected, even when, for example, they contain high concentrations of dissolved Fe. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Spratlen2017,
	abstract = {B-vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism (OCM) can affect arsenic metabolism efficiency in highly arsenic exposed, undernourished populations. We evaluated whether dietary intake of OCM nutrients (including vitamins B2, B6, folate (B9), and B12) was associated with arsenic metabolism in a more nourished population exposed to lower arsenic than previously studied. Dietary intake of OCM nutrients and urine arsenic was evaluated in 405 participants from the Strong Heart Study. Arsenic exposure was measured as the sum of iAs, monomethylarsonate (MMA) and dimethylarsenate (DMA) in urine. Arsenic metabolism was measured as the individual percentages of each metabolite over their sum (iAs{\%}, MMA{\%}, DMA{\%}). In adjusted models, increasing intake of vitamins B2 and B6 was associated with modest but significant decreases in iAs{\%} and MMA{\%} and increases in DMA{\%}. A significant interaction was found between high folate and B6 with enhanced arsenic metabolism efficiency. Our findings suggest OCM nutrients may influence arsenic metabolism in populations with moderate arsenic exposure. Stronger and independent associations were observed with B2 and B6, vitamins previously understudied in relation to arsenic. Research is needed to evaluate whether targeting B-vitamin intake can serve as a strategy for the prevention of arsenic-related health effects at low-moderate arsenic exposure.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyse the relative effect of the risk factors related to fetal growth retardation (FGR) in the central area of Spain. Study design: This is a case-control survey of 370 full-term gestations. Of the 370 women, 185 were diagnosed with intrauterine growth retardation, and 185 were in the normal group. All came from a central region of Spain. We took into account 25 possible risk factors. Results: In the FGR group we found 12 risk factors with statistical significance in the univariate analysis (tobacco, drugs, low pre-pregnancy weight, low maternal height, little gestational weight gain, excessive physical activity during pregnancy, low socioeconomic status, low educational level, unmarried, urinary infection, mother's haematological changes, and previous infertility). After the multiple logistic regression analysis, five factors were shown to exist as independent risks (tobacco: OR, 23.50; 95{\%} CI, 3.01-183.18; P {\textless} 0.01; low pre-pregnancy weight: OR, 4.01; 95{\%} CI, 2.14-7.51; P {\textless} 0.001; low socioeconomic status: OR, 2.91; 95{\%} CI, 1.72-4.90; P {\textless} 0.001; little gestational weight gain: OR, 2.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-5.22; P {\textless} 0.05; and urinary infection: OR, 3.83; 95{\%} CI, 1.49-9.87; P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: (i) Tobacco, low pre-pregnancy weight and low socioeconomic status are the three main cause-effect factors of relative importance in our sanitary zone for FGR. (ii) Disproportionate FGR is related more to older mothers and maternal previous illness than to the proportionate FGR. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are posing greater risk to the world population as it is now increasing at a faster rate. We have investigated the role of sodium butyrate, a selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and aminoguanidine, a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor in pharmacological interdiction of arsenic toxicity induced vascular endothelial dysfunction and dementia in rats. Arsenic toxicity was done by administering arsenic drinking water to rats. Morris water-maze (MWM) test was used for assessment of learning and memory. Endothelial function was assessed using student physiograph. Oxidative stress (aortic superoxide anion, serum and brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species, brain glutathione) and nitric oxide levels (serum nitrite/nitrate) were also measured. Arsenic treated rats have shown impairment of endothelial function, learning and memory, reduction in serum nitrite/nitrate {\&} brain GSH levels along with increase in serum {\&} brain TBARS. Sodium butyrate as well as aminoguanidine significantly convalesce arsenic induced impairment of learning, memory, endothelial function, and alterations in various biochemical parameters. It may be concluded that arsenic induces endothelial dysfunction and dementia, whereas, sodium butyrate, a HDAC inhibitor as well as aminoguanidine, a selective iNOS inhibitor may be considered as potential agents for the management of arsenic induced endothelial dysfunction and dementia. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{YANG2017151,
	abstract = {To meet the major challenge of increasing rice production to feed a growing population under increasing water scarcity, many water-saving regimes have been introduced in irrigated rice, such as an aerobic rice system, non-flooded mulching cultivation, and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). These regimes could substantially enhance water use efficiency (WUE) by reducing irrigation water. However, such enhancements greatly compromise grain yield. Recent work has shown that moderate AWD, in which photosynthesis is not severely inhibited and plants can rehydrate overnight during the soil drying period, or plants are rewatered at a soil water potential of −10 to −15kPa, or midday leaf potential is approximately −0.60 to −0.80MPa, or the water table is maintained at 10 to 15cm below the soil surface, could increase not only WUE but also grain yield. Increases in grain yield WUE under moderate AWD are due mainly to reduced redundant vegetative growth; improved canopy structure and root growth; elevated hormonal levels, in particular increases in abscisic acid levels during soil drying and cytokinin levels during rewatering; and enhanced carbon remobilization from vegetative tissues to grain. Moderate AWD could also improve rice quality, including reductions in grain arsenic accumulation, and reduce methane emissions from paddies. Adoption of moderate AWD with an appropriate nitrogen application rate may exert a synergistic effect on grain yield and result in higher WUE and nitrogen use efficiency. Further research is needed to understand root--soil interaction and evaluate the long-term effects of moderate AWD on sustainable agriculture.},

@article{Signes-Pastor2012,
	abstract = {UNLABELLED: Rice can easily accumulate arsenic (As) into its grain and is known to be the highest As-containing cereal. In addition, the As burden in rice may increase during its processing (such as when cooking using As-polluted water). The health risk posed by the presence of As in cooked rice depends on its release from the matrix along the digestive system (bioaccessibility). Two types of white polished long-grain rice, namely, nonparboiled and parboiled (total As: 202 and 190 $\mu$g As kg(-1), respectively), were cooked in excess of water with different levels of As (0, 10, 47, 222, and 450 $\mu$g As L(-1)). The bioaccessibility of As from these cooked rice batches was evaluated with an in vitro dynamic digestion process. Rice cooked with water containing 0 and 10 $\mu$g As L(-1) showed lower As concentrations than the raw (uncooked) rice. However, cooking water with relatively high As content (≥ 47 $\mu$g As L(-1)) significantly increased the As concentration in the cooked rice up to 8- and 9-fold for the nonparboiled and parboiled rice, respectively. Parboiled rice, which is most widely consumed in South Asia, showed a higher percentage of As bioaccessibility (59{\%} to 99{\%}) than nonparboiled rice (36{\%} to 69{\%}) and most of the As bioaccessible in the cooked rice (80{\%} to 99{\%}) was released easily during the first 2 h of digestion. The estimation of the As intake through cooked rice based on the As bioaccessibility highlights that a few grams of cooked rice (less than 25 g dry weight per day) cooked with highly As contaminated water is equivalent to the amount of As from 2 L water containing the maximum permissible limit (10 $\mu$g As L(-1)).

PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Studies on As bioaccessibility are needed for determining human As intake from rice for use in accurate risk assessments to establish updated legislation regarding maximum level of As in food. High As bioaccessibility from parboiled rice (consumed by the majority of the people in South Asia), and the findings of high As levels in discarded rice gruel (fed to livestock), has implications for human and animal health.},

	abstract = {Infants and young children commonly consume apple-based products, which may contain high concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs). As yet, iAs exposure from ingesting apple products has not been well characterized in early childhood. Therefore, we investigated the association between urinary arsenic concentrations and intake of apple products in 1-year-old infants participating in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. A 3-day food diary prior to collection of a spot urine sample was used to determine infant's consumption of apple products. The sum of urinary iAs, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid, referred to as $\Sigma$As, was used to estimate iAs exposure. A total of 242 infants had urinary arsenic speciation analyzed without indication of fish/seafood consumption (urinary arsenobetaine {\textless} 1 µg/L) and with a completed 3-day food diary. Of these, 183 (76{\%}) infants ate apples or products containing apple. The geometric mean urinary $\Sigma$As among the 59 infants who did not consume any type of apple product was 2.78 µg/L as compared to 2.38, 2.46, 2.28, and 2.73 µg/L among infants who exclusively consumed apple juice (n = 30), apple puree (n = 67), apples as whole fruit (n = 20), or products mixed with apples (n = 21), respectively. Differences in urinary $\Sigma$As associated with apple consumption were not statistically significant in generalized linear models adjusted for urine dilution, rice consumption, and household water arsenic. Thus, while infants in our study frequently consumed apples and apple products, we did not find evidence that it increased iAs exposure.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase growing temperatures in rice cultivating regions worldwide. Recent research demonstrates that elevated temperature can increase arsenic concentrations in rice tissue, exacerbating an existing threat to rice quality and human health. However, the specific temperature-induced changes in the plant-soil system responsible for increased arsenic concentrations remain unclear and such knowledge is necessary to manage human dietary arsenic exposure in a warmer future. To elucidate these changes, we established four temperature treatments in climate-controlled growth chambers and grew rice plants (Oryza sativa cv. M206) in pots filled with Californian paddy soil with arsenic concentrations of 7.7 mg kg−1. The four chosen temperatures mimicked IPCC forecasting for Northern California, with a roughly 2.5 $\,^{\circ}$C increase between treatments (nighttime temperatures {\~{}}2 $\,^{\circ}$C cooler). We observed that arsenic concentrations in porewater, root iron plaque, and plant tissue increased in response to elevated temperature. There was a positive linear relationship between temperature and rice grain arsenic, almost all of which was present as inorganic As (III). Above-ground allocation patterns were consistent across treatments. We found no upregulation in the gene encoding the OsABCC1 transporter, believed to be important for arsenic sequestration in vacuoles and thereby preventing arsenic transfer to grain. Rice plants grown at higher temperatures had more adsorbed arsenic per unit of iron plaque (measured as [As]/[Fe]), indicating temperature may impact arsenic sorption to root plaque. We present evidence that increased soil mobilization of arsenic was the driving factor responsible for increased arsenic uptake into rice grain. Transpiration, which can increase arsenic transport to roots, was also heightened with elevated temperature but appeared to play a secondary role. Our system had low soil arsenic concentrations typical for California. Our findings highlight that elevated growing temperatures may increase the risk of dietary arsenic exposure in rice systems that were previously considered low risk.},

Literature related to both analytical procedures and intrinsic characteristics of the biomarker is reviewed. Specifically, the followings are addressed: sample collection and preparation methods, establishment of the exposure-biomarker relationship, intraindividual variability and reproducibility of measurements, and biomarker-disease investigations. Drawing from a rapidly growing body of literature, current knowledge of these biomarker validation steps is assessed. Therefore, this review brings attention to the important issue of biomarker validation, laying the framework for future studies measuring elemental composition of nails. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {There are limited data examining the consequences of environmental exposure to arsenic on the immune system in adults, particularly among smokers. Smoking has been shown to exacerbate or contribute to impaired immune function in men chronically exposed to arsenic. In contrast, vitamin D (VitD) is known to have a positive influence on innate and adaptive immune responses. The effect of circulating VitD on arsenic-associated immune dysfunction is not known. Here we examine the relationship of arsenic exposure and T cell proliferation (TCP), a measure of immune responsiveness, and circulating VitD among adult men and women in Bangladesh. Arsenic exposure was assessed using total urinary arsenic as well as urinary arsenic metabolites all adjusted for urinary creatinine. TCP was measured ex vivo in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 614 adult participants enrolled in the Bangladesh Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study; serum VitD was also evaluated. The influence of cigarette smoking on arsenic-induced TCP modulation was assessed only in males as there was an inadequate number of female smokers. These studies show that arsenic suppressed TCP in males. The association was significantly strong in male smokers and to a lesser extent in male non-smokers. Interestingly, we found a strong protective effect of high/sufficient serum VitD levels on TCP among non-smoking males. Furthermore, among male smokers with low serum VitD (∐20 ng/ml), we found a strong suppression of TCP by arsenic. On the other hand, high VitD ({\textgreater}20 ng/ml) was found to attenuate effects of arsenic on TCP among male-smokers. Overall, we found a strong protective effect of VitD, when serum levels were {\textgreater}20 ng/ml, on arsenic-induced inhibition of TCP in men, irrespective of smoking status. To our knowledge this is the first large study of immune function in healthy adult males and females with a history of chronic arsenic exposure.},

	abstract = {Occupational exposure in copper smelters may produce various adverse health effects including cancer which, according to available epidemiologic data, is associated mainly with exposure to arsenic. Despite a number of well-documented studies reporting an increased risk of cancer among copper smelters workers, the data on genotoxic effects in this industry are scarce. In view of the above, an assessment of micronuclei (MN) frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes and buccal epithelial cells from copper smelter workers was undertaken. Additionally, the clastogenic/aneugenic effect in lymphocytes was assessed with the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The study was conducted in three copper smelters in southwestern Poland. The subjects (n = 72) were enrolled among male workers at departments where As concentration in the air was up to at 80 microg/m(3). Exposure was assessed by measurement of arsenic concentration in urine and toenail samples. The control group (n = 83) was recruited from healthy male individuals living in central Poland who did not report any exposure to known genotoxins. The results of our study showed a significant increase in MN frequency in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in buccal epithelial cells of smelter workers, compared to the controls (7.96 +/- 4.28 vs. 3.47 +/- 1.70 and 0.98 +/- 0.76 vs. 0.50 +/- 0.52, respectively). The FISH technique revealed the presence of clastogenic and aneugenic effects in peripheral blood lymphocytes in both groups. The clastogenic effect was slightly more pronounced in the smelter workers; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The mean arsenic concentrations in urine (total arsenic species) and in toenail samples in the exposed group were 54.04 +/- 42.26 microg/l and 7.63 +/- 7.24 microg/g, respectively, being significantly different from control group 11.01 +/- 10.84 microg/l and 0.51 +/- 0.05 microg/g. No correlation between As content in urine or toenail samples and the genotoxic effect was found under study.},

	abstract = {While it is known that toxic metals contribute individually to child cognitive and behavioral deficits, we still know little about the effects of exposure to multiple metals, particularly when exposures are low. We studied the association between children's blood lead and hair arsenic, cadmium, and manganese and their performance on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III. Ninety-two preschool children (age 13-42 months) from Montevideo, Uruguay, provided a hair sample and 78 had a blood lead level (BLL) measurement. Using latent class analysis (LCA), we identified four groups of exposure based on metal concentrations: (1) low metals, (2) low-to-moderate metals, (3) high lead and cadmium, and (4) high metals. Using the four-group exposure variable as the main predictor, and fitting raw scores on the cognitive, receptive vocabulary, and expressive vocabulary scales as dependent variables, both complete-case and multiple imputation (MI) analyses were conducted. We found no association between multiple-metal exposures and neurodevelopment in covariate-adjusted models. This study demonstrates the use of LCA together with MI to determine patterns of exposure to multiple toxic metals and relate these to child neurodevelopment. However, because the overall study population was small, other studies with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate these associations.},

Little is known about the association of rice consumption with arsenic-related health effects, particularly interstitial lung disease. Between 2000 and 2002, 6,814 white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese adults from 6 US cities were enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We included 2,250 participants who had spirometry data, 2,557 with full-lung computed tomography (CT) scans, and 5,710 with cardiac CT scans. Rice consumption and 310 participants with urinary arsenic were assessed at baseline. Spirometry and full-lung CT-derived measures of total lung capacity and high attenuation area (HAA), and interstitial lung abnormalities were measured at examination 5. Cardiac CT-derived HAA was measured at 1-3 visits. Twelve percent of participants reported eating at least 1 serving of rice daily. Comparing data between that group with those who ate less than 1 serving weekly, the mean difference for forced vital capacity was-102 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI):-198,-7) mL, and for forced expiratory volume in 1 second was-90 (95{\%} CI:-170,-11) mL after adjustment for demographics, anthropometrics, dietary factors, and smoking. The cross-sectional adjusted percent difference for total lung capacity was-1.33{\%} (95{\%} CI:-4.29, 1.72) and for cardiac-based HAA was 3.66{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.22, 6.15). Sensitivity analyses for urinary arsenic were consistent with rice findings. Daily rice consumption was associated with reduced lung function and greater cardiac-based HAA.},

@article{Lubin2004,
	abstract = {Quantitative measurements of environmental factors greatly improve the quality of epidemiologic studies but can pose challenges because of the presence of upper or lower detection limits or interfering compounds, which do not allow for precise measured values. We consider the regression of an environmental measurement (dependent variable) on several covariates (independent variables). Various strategies are commonly employed to impute values for interval-measured data, including assignment of one-half the detection limit to nondetected values or of "fill-in" values randomly selected from an appropriate distribution. On the basis of a limited simulation study, we found that the former approach can be biased unless the percentage of measurements below detection limits is small (5-10{\%}). The fill-in approach generally produces unbiased parameter estimates but may produce biased variance estimates and thereby distort inference when 30{\%} or more of the data are below detection limits. Truncated data methods (e.g., Tobit regression) and multiple imputation offer two unbiased approaches for analyzing measurement data with detection limits. If interest resides solely on regression parameters, then Tobit regression can be used. If individualized values for measurements below detection limits are needed for additional analysis, such as relative risk regression or graphical display, then multiple imputation produces unbiased estimates and nominal confidence intervals unless the proportion of missing data is extreme. We illustrate various approaches using measurements of pesticide residues in carpet dust in control subjects from a case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

@article{Xu2008,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) exposure from consumption of rice can be substantial, particularly for the population on a subsistence rice diet in South Asia. Paddy rice has a much enhanced As accumulation compared with other cereal crops, and practical measures are urgently needed to decrease As transfer from soil to grain. We investigated the dynamics of As speciation in the soil solution under both flooded and aerobic conditions and compared As accumulation in rice shoot and grain in a greenhouse experiment. Flooding of soil led to a rapid mobilization of As, mainly as arsenite, in the soil solution. Arsenic concentrations in the soil solution were 7-16 and 4-13 times higher under the flooded than under the aerobic conditions in the control without As addition and in the +As treatments (10 mg As kg(-1) as arsenite or arsenate), respectively. Arsenate was the main As species in the aerobic soil. Arsenic accumulation in rice shoots and grain was markedly increased under flooded conditions; grain As concentrations were 10-15-fold higher in flooded than in aerobically grown rice. With increasing total As concentrations in grain, the proportion of inorganic As decreased, while that of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) increased. The concentration of inorganic As was 2.6-2.9 fold higher in the grain from the flooded treatment than in that from the aerobic treatment. The results demonstrate that a greatly increased bioavailability of As under the flooded conditions is the main reason for an enhanced As accumulation by flooded rice, and growing rice aerobically can dramatically decrease the As transfer from soil to grain.},

About 75.6{\%} of hair samples from the population in this study contained As levels higher than the normal level in unexposed individuals (1 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1). Most of the population (83.3{\%}) showed As urinary levels exceeding the normal ({\textless}50 ng{\textperiodcentered}mg−1).

The ICP-MS measurements were performed using a Thermo Elemental X7CCT series. Fingernail specimens were obtained from 130 healthy volunteers, and paired fingernail and toenail samples from 50 additional healthy volunteers of both sexes were collected as well. After warm water and acetone decontamination, 20 mg fingernails and toenails were acid mineralized after a decontamination procedure, and 32-34 elements were simultaneously quantified after acid dilution following water calibration. Li, Be, B, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Pd, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, Ba, La, Gd, W, Pt, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and U could be validated in fingernail and toenail samples. Linearity was excellent, and the correlation coefficients were above 0.999. Quantification limits ranged from 0.04 pg/mg or ng/g (U) to 0.1 ng/mg or microg/g (B). Because of the lack of available certified nail reference material, an adequate quality assessment scheme was ensured by comparison with an interlaboratory nail-testing procedure, and the results showed optimal consistency for elements tested. Results are presented and compared with published multielement data. Six cases of domestic exposure to lead were diagnosed based on fingernail analysis. Application of ICP-MS multielement analysis in fingernail and toenail as a biomarker of metal and nonmetal exposure permits greater noninvasive control of industrial, domestic, or environmental exposure and is very useful for epidemiological studies.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Puberty may influence lung function, but the precise role of pubertal height growth in lung development is unclear. Objectives: To examine associations of timing of puberty and peak velocity of pubertal height growth with lung function in adolescence and early adulthood. Methods: Longitudinal analyses of repeat height measurements from age 5 to 20 years for a British birth cohort with 4,772 males and 4,849 females were conducted to characterize height growth trajectories and to derive pubertal age and peak height velocity using the validated SITAR (SuperImposition by Translation and Rotation) model. Association of these estimates with prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measures: FEV 1 ; FVC; FEV1/FVC; FEF 2 5-7 5{\%} at age 15 and 24 years were investigated using multivariable regression models adjusted for lung function at age 8 years, height and age at time of outcome measurements, and potential confounders. Measurements and Main Results: Later pubertal age and greater peak velocity were associated with higher FEV1 and FVC at 24 years in both sexes. A 1-year increase in pubertal age was associated with a 263-ml higher FVC (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 167-360 ml) for males (n = 567) and 100-ml (95{\%} CI, 50-150 ml) higher FVC for females (n = 990). A 1-cm/yr increase in peak velocity was associated with 145-ml (95{\%} CI, 56-234 ml) and 50-ml (95{\%} CI, 2-99 ml) increases in FVC for males and females, respectively. No associations were found with FEV 1 /FVC. Conclusions: Later onset and greater peak velocity of height growth in puberty are associated with increased FEV1 and FVC in young adults but there was no evidence of dysanapsis of pubertal lung growth.},

Telomerase-containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) can extend telomeres of chromosomes, delay senescence, and promote cell proliferation leading to tumorigenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of As on hTERT mRNA expression in humans and in vitro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A total of 324 Inner Mongolia residents who have been exposed to As via drinking water participated in this study. Water and toenail samples were collected and analyzed for As. Blood samples were quantified for hTERT mRNA expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The hTERT mRNA levels were linked to water and nail As concentrations and skin hyperkeratosis. Human epidermal keratinocytes were treated with arsenite to assess effects on cell viability and hTERT expression in vitro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: hTERT mRNA expression levels were significantly associated with As concentrations of water (p{\textless}0.0001) and nails (p=0.002) and also associated with severity of skin hyperkeratosis (p{\textless}0.05), adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and pesticide use. Females showed a higher slope than males (females: 0.126, p=0.0005; males: 0.079, p=0.017). In addition to water and nail As concentrations, age (p{\textless}0.0001) and pesticide use (p=0.025) also showed significant associations with hTERT expression. The hTERT expression levels decreased with age. Tobacco smoking did not affect hTERT expression (p=0.13). hTERT expression was significantly correlated with OGG1 and ERCC1 expression. The in vitro results also showed a dose-response relationship between arsenite concentrations and hTERT expression and reached the peak at 1 microM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: hTERT expression was associated with As exposure in vivo and in vitro. The increased hTERT expression may be a cellular response to genomic insults by As and may also indicate that As may function as a tumor promoter in carcinogenesis in humans.},

	abstract = {Prenatal arsenic exposure has been associated with reduced fetal growth and increased risk for preterm birth, but most studies have been conducted in highly exposed populations outside the U.S. or in non-Hispanic populations in the rural U.S. The objectives of the current study were to: 1) examine the impact of early pregnancy exposure to arsenic on birth weight and gestational age at birth in a predominately lower income Hispanic pregnancy cohort in urban Los Angeles and 2) compare multiple biomarkers of arsenic exposure (blood, urine, and hair) assessed in early pregnancy (mean $\pm$ SD gestational age at biospecimen collection: 14 $\pm$ 4 weeks). Total arsenic (blood, hair) was measured by ICP-MS and speciated arsenic (urine) was measured by HPLC coupled to ICP-MS. Associations between log2-transformed arsenic measures and birth outcomes were evaluated using multivariable linear regression. A doubling in hair arsenic was associated with a 72.2 g (95{\%} CI: −144.3, −0.1, P = 0.05) lower birth weight, after adjusting for potential confounders and gestational age at birth. A similar but non-significant trend was observed for blood arsenic, but not urine arsenic. The inverse association between hair arsenic and birth weight was more pronounced among infants whose mothers gained greater amounts of weight during pregnancy (Pinteraction = 0.02). The association between urinary monomethyl arsenic and GA at birth differed by pre-pregnancy BMI (Pinteraction{\textless}0.01). This study provides evidence that even at relatively low levels of exposure, arsenic exposure (measured in hair samples collected in early pregnancy) may adversely affect fetal growth in this understudied population, particularly in combination with greater gestational weight gain. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and to further investigate some of the inconsistencies observed for the different arsenic biomarkers evaluated.},

Reproductive histories were ascertained using structured interviews. Arsenic exposure during each pregnancy, including all water sources used, was assessed; this involved measurements from 409 wells. Odds ratios for spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and infant mortality were estimated with logistic regression based on the method of generalized estimating equations. Exposure to high concentrations of arsenic ({\textgreater} or =200 microg/liter) during pregnancy was associated with a sixfold increased risk of stillbirth after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio (OR) = 6.07, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.54, 24.0; p = 0.01). Arsenic-related skin lesions were found in 12 women who had a substantially increased risk of stillbirth (OR = 13.1, 95{\%} CI: 3.17, 54.0; p = 0.002). The odds ratio for neonatal death was 2.81 (95{\%} CI: 0.73, 10.8). No association was found between arsenic exposure and spontaneous abortion (OR = 1.01, 95{\%} CI: 0.38, 2.70) or overall infant mortality (OR = 1.33, 95{\%} CI: 0.43, 4.04). This study adds to the limited evidence that exposure to high concentrations of arsenic during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth. However, there was no indication of the increased rates of spontaneous abortion and overall infant mortality that have been reported in some studies.},

Under aerobic conditions, As solubility was low, however, under moderately reducing conditions (0, - 150 mV), As solubility significantly increased due to dissolution of iron oxy-hydroxides. Upon reduction to - 250 mV, As solubility was controlled by the formation of insoluble sulfides, and as a result soluble As contents significantly decreased. Soluble Fe concentration increased from moderate to highly anaerobic conditions; however, it decreased under aerobic conditions likely due to formation of insoluble oxy-hydroxides. A low pH, 5.5, led to increased soluble concentrations of As, Fe, and P. Finally, addition of P-fertilizers resulted in higher soluble P and As, even though the concentration of As did not increased after an addition rate of 600 mg P kg- 1 soil. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, serum hepatic enzyme activity as recognized on liver function tests (LFTs) showing a dose-response relationship with arsenic exposure has not yet been clearly documented. The aim of our study was to investigate the dose-response relationship between arsenic exposure and major serum enzyme marker activity associated with LFTs in the population living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 200 residents living in arsenic-endemic areas in Bangladesh were selected as study subjects. Arsenic concentrations in the drinking water, hair and nails were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The study subjects were stratified into quartile groups as follows, based on concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water, as well as in subjects' hair and nails: lowest, low, medium and high. The serum hepatic enzyme activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were then assayed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in the subjects' hair and nails were positively correlated with arsenic levels in the drinking water. As regards the exposure-response relationship with arsenic in the drinking water, the respective activities of ALP, AST and ALT were found to be significantly increased in the high-exposure groups compared to the lowest-exposure groups before and after adjustments were made for different covariates. With internal exposure markers (arsenic in hair and nails), the ALP, AST and ALT activity profiles assumed a similar shape of dose-response relationship, with very few differences seen in the higher groups compared to the lowest group, most likely due to the temporalities of exposure metrics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that arsenic concentrations in the drinking water were strongly correlated with arsenic concentrations in the subjects' hair and nails. Further, this study revealed a novel exposure- and dose- response relationship between arsenic exposure metrics and serum hepatic enzyme activity. Elevated serum hepatic enzyme activities in the higher exposure gradients provided new insights into arsenic-induced liver toxicity that might be helpful for the early prognosis of arsenic-induced liver diseases.},

	abstract = {The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) introduces a new translational research framework that builds upon previous biomedical models to create a more comprehensive and integrated environmental health paradigm. The framework was developed as a graphical construct that illustrates the complexity of designing, implementing, and tracking translational research in environmental health. We conceptualize translational research as a series of concentric rings and nodes, defining ``translation'' as movement either from one ring to another or between nodes on a ring. A ``Fundamental Questions'' ring expands upon the research described in other frameworks as ``basic'' to include three interrelated concepts critical to basic science research: research questions, experimental settings, and organisms. This feature enables us to capture more granularity and thus facilitates an approach for categorizing translational research and its growth over time. We anticipate that the framework will help researchers develop compelling long-term translational research stories and accelerate public health impacts by clearly mapping out opportunities for collaborations. By using this paradigm, researchers everywhere will be better positioned to design research programs, identify research partners based on cross-disciplinary research needs, identify stakeholders who are likely to use the research for environmental decision-making and intervention, and track progress toward common goals.},

	abstract = {The contamination of groundwater by arsenic in Bangladesh is the largest poisoning of a population in history, with millions of people exposed. This paper describes the history of the discovery of arsenic in drinking-water in Bangladesh and recommends intervention strategies. Tube-wells were installed to provide 'pure water' to prevent morbidity and mortality from gastrointestinal disease. The water from the millions of tube-wells that were installed was not tested for arsenic contamination. Studies in other countries where the population has had long-term exposure to arsenic in groundwater indicate that 1 in 10 people who drink water containing 500 $\mu$g of arsenic per litre may ultimately die from cancers caused by arsenic, including lung, bladder and skin cancers. The rapid allocation of funding and prompt expansion of current interventions to address this contamination should be facilitated. The fundamental intervention is the identification and provision of arsenic-free drinking water. Arsenic is rapidly excreted in urine, and for early or mild cases, no specific treatment is required. Community education and participation are essential to ensure that interventions are successful; these should be coupled with follow-up monitoring to confirm that exposure has ended. Taken together with the discovery of arsenic in groundwater in other countries, the experience in Bangladesh shows that groundwater sources throughout the world that are used for drinking-water should be tested for arsenic.},

Rice is an important source of arsenic for the Bengali population, because cooked rice is their staple food and it accumulates higher levels of arsenic (339 ¿g As/kg) than other vegetables (75 ¿g As/kg) and spices (91 ¿g As/kg). It was estimated that the daily arsenic intake of this population is 1.5, 6.8 and 13.3-fold the Provisional Tolerable Daily Intake (2.14 ¿g i-As/day/kg body weight) when cooking and drinking water contained 50, 250 or 500 ¿g As/L, respectively. Cooked rice itself represented by up to 45 {\%} of the total daily arsenic intake. Rice accumulates high levels of arsenic because of its cultivation system (flooding) and arsenic biogeochemistry. Arsenic is highly available for plant uptake at low pH (pH 5.5) and under moderately anaerobic conditions (between +50 mV and -150 mV). The two most popular methods of dehusking rice changed the arsenic concentration in the commercial rice in West Bengal (atab and parboiled rice). Atab rice, obtained from the dry dehusking procedure, showed lower arsenic concentration (290 ¿g As/kg) than parboiled rice (332 ¿g As/kg), obtained from the wet dehusking procedure. The cooking process increased the arsenic concentration in the cooked rice up to 874 and 1642 ¿g As/kg when cooking raw rice (247 ¿g As/kg) with water containing 250 or 500 ¿g As/L, respectively. However, the arsenic concentration in cooked rice (227 ¿g As/kg) was reduced up to 30 {\%} when the cooking water had 50 ¿g As/L. The cooking method affected significantly the arsenic concentration in the cooked rice. The cooked rice contained 258, 365 and 387 ¿g As/kg when it was cooked following the traditional, intermediate and contemporary method along with cooking water with 40 ¿g As/L. Besides, atab rice always showed lower levels of arsenic (283 ¿g As/kg) than parboiled rice (390 ¿g As/kg) independently of the cooking method used. It is recommendable to obtain atab rice after dehusking process and to cook it in excess of water after washing (traditional method) if water free of arsenic is not available. This way the arsenic exposure can be reduced by up to 20 {\%} or 30 {\%} when rice plus drinking water (40 ¿g As/L) or only rice are used to estimate the daily arsenic intake, respectively.},

In 2003, the number of birth defects in Al Basrah Maternity Hospitalwas 23per1,000 live births. Within less than a decade, the occurrence of con- genital birth defects increased by an astonishing 17-fold in the same hospital. A yearly account of the occurrence and types of birth defects, between 2003 and 2011, in Al Basrah Maternity Hospital, was reported. Metal levels in hair, toe- nail, and tooth samples of residents of Al Basrah were also provided. The enamel portion of the deciduous tooth from a child with birth defects from Al Basrah (4.19 lg/g) had nearly three times higher lead than the whole teeth of chil- dren living in unimpacted areas. Lead was 1.4 times higher in the tooth enamel of parents of children with birth defects (2,497 $\pm$ 1,400 lg/g, mean $\pm$ SD) compared to parents of normal children (1,826 $\pm$ 1,819 lg/g). Our data suggested that birth defects in the Iraqi cities of Al Basrah (in the south of Iraq) and Fallujah (in central Iraq) are mainly folate-dependent. Thisknowledge offers possible treatment options and remediation plans for at-risk Iraqi populations.},

	abstract = {Arsenic exposure may contribute to disease risk in humans through alterations in the epigenome. Previous studies reported that arsenic exposure is associated with changes in plasma histone concentrations. Posttranslational histone modifications have been found to differ between the brain tissue of human embryos with neural tube defects and that of controls. Our objectives were to investigate the relationships between plasma histone 3 levels, history of having an infant with myelomeningocele, biomarkers of arsenic exposure, and maternal folate deficiency. These studies took place in Bangladesh, a country with high environmental arsenic exposure through contaminated drinking water. We performed ELISA assays to investigate plasma concentration of total histone 3 (H3) and the histone modification H3K27me3. The plasma samples were collected from 85 adult women as part of a case-control study of arsenic and myelomeningocele risk in Bangladesh. We found significant associations between plasma {\%}H3K27me3 levels and risk of myelomeningocele (P{\textless}0.05). Mothers with higher {\%}H3K27me3 in their plasma had lower risk of having an infant with myelomeningocele (odds ratio: 0.91, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.84, 0.98). We also found that arsenic exposure, as estimated by arsenic concentration in toenails, was associated with lower total H3 concentrations in plasma, but only among women with folate deficiency ($\beta$ = −9.99, standard error = 3.91, P=0.02). Our results suggest that {\%}H3K27me3 in maternal plasma differs between mothers of infants with myelomeningocele and mothers of infants without myelomeningocele, and may be a marker for myelomeningocele risk. Women with folate deficiency may be more susceptible to the epigenetic effects of environmental arsenic exposure.},

	abstract = {This cross-sectional study examined the possible influence on the development of cognitive function among adolescents due to long-term arsenic exposure. Forty-nine junior school students drinking arsenic-containing well water and 60 controls matched with age, sex, education, body height, body weight, body mass index, and socioeconomic status were compared. The former was divided into two groups: high and low exposure, with mean cumulative arsenic levels of 520629.0 $\pm$ 605824.2 and 13782.2 $\pm$ 12886.0 ppm, respectively. Four neurobehavioral tests including continuous performance test (CPT), symbol digit (SD), pattern memory (PM) and switching attention (SA) were applied. A strong correlation between age and education caused collinearity in the multiple regression model (r = 0.84, P {\textless} 0.0001). Only education and sex, excluding age, were entered into the model as covariates. Pattern memory and switching attention were significantly affected by long-term cumulative exposure to arsenic after adjusting for education and sex. It is suggested that the arsenic levels in the well water may be monitored extensively, but if there is no intervention, then neurobehavioral function will not be protected. Limitations of the current study require replication of this effect in other studies to confirm this conclusion. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Applebaum2007,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic exposure may alter the efficiency of DNA repair. UV damage is specifically repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER), and common genetic variants in NER may increase risk for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). OBJECTIVE: We tested whether polymorphisms in the NER genes XPA (A23G) and XPD (Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln) modify the association between arsenic and NMSC. METHODS: Incident cases of basal and squamous cell carcinoma (BCC and SCC, respectively) were identified through a network of dermatologists and pathology laboratories across New Hampshire. Population-based controls were frequency matched to cases on age and sex. Arsenic exposure was assessed in toenail clippings. The analysis included 880 cases of BCC, 666 cases of SCC, and 780 controls. RESULTS: There was an increased BCC risk associated with high arsenic exposure among those homozygous variant for XPA [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.9-3.7]. For XPD, having variation at both loci (312Asn and 751Gln) occurred less frequently among BCC and SCC cases compared with controls (OR = 0.8; 95{\%} CI, 0.6-1.0) for both case groups. In the stratum of subjects who have variant for both XPD polymorphisms, there was a 2-fold increased risk of SCC associated with elevated arsenic (OR = 2.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.0-5.0). The test for interaction between XPD and arsenic in SCC was of borderline significance (p {\textless} 0.07, 3 degrees of freedom). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate a reduced NMSC risk in relation to XPD Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln variants. Further, these data support the hypothesis that NER polymorphisms may modify the association between NMSC and arsenic.},

	abstract = {Individual variations in inorganic arsenic metabolism may influence the toxic effects. Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) that can catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to trivalent arsenical, may play a role in arsenic metabolism in humans. Since the genetic polymorphisms of AS3MT gene may be associated with the susceptibility to inorganic arsenic toxicity, relationships of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in AS3MT with inorganic arsenic metabolism have been investigated. Here, we summarize our recent findings and other previous studies on the inorganic arsenic metabolism and AS3MT genetic polymorphisms in humans. Results of genotype dependent differences in arsenic metabolism for most of SNPs in AS3MT were Inconsistent throughout the studies. Nevertheless, two SNPs, AS3MT 12390 (rs3740393) and 14458 (rs11191439) were consistently related to arsenic methylation regardless of the populations examined for the analysis. Thus, these SNPs may be useful indicators to predict the arsenic metabolism via methylation pathways. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Placental 8-oxoG was significantly positively associated with placental proinflammatory cytokines. Multivariable adjusted analyses suggested that enhanced placental cytokine expression (TNF$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$) was primarily influenced by oxidative stress, whereas leptin expression appeared to be mostly mediated by As, and IL-1$\beta$ appeared to be influenced by both oxidative stress and As.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: As exposure during pregnancy appeared to enhance placental inflammatory responses (in part by increasing oxidative stress), reduce placental T cells, and alter cord blood cytokines.

	abstract = {Background: Lifetime lung function is related to quality of life and longevity. Over the lifespan, individuals follow different lung function trajectories. Identification of these trajectories, their determinants, and outcomes is important, but no study has done this beyond the fourth decade. Methods: We used six waves of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) to model lung function trajectories measured at 7, 13, 18, 45, 50, and 53 years. We analysed pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 z-scores at the six timepoints using group-based trajectory modelling to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose measurements followed a similar pattern over time. We related the trajectories identified to childhood factors and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using logistic regression, and estimated population-attributable fractions of COPD. Findings: Of the 8583 participants in the original cohort, 2438 had at least two waves of lung function data at age 7 years and 53 years and comprised the study population. We identified six trajectories: early below average, accelerated decline (97 [4{\%}] participants); persistently low (136 [6{\%}] participants); early low, accelerated growth, normal decline (196 [8{\%}] participants); persistently high (293 [12{\%}] participants); below average (772 [32{\%}] participants); and average (944 [39{\%}] participants). The three trajectories early below average, accelerated decline; persistently low; and below average had increased risk of COPD at age 53 years compared with the average group (early below average, accelerated decline: odds ratio 35{\textperiodcentered}0, 95{\%} CI 19{\textperiodcentered}5--64{\textperiodcentered}0; persistently low: 9{\textperiodcentered}5, 4{\textperiodcentered}5--20{\textperiodcentered}6; and below average: 3{\textperiodcentered}7, 1{\textperiodcentered}9--6{\textperiodcentered}9). Early-life predictors of the three trajectories included childhood asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis, eczema, parental asthma, and maternal smoking. Personal smoking and active adult asthma increased the impact of maternal smoking and childhood asthma, respectively, on the early below average, accelerated decline trajectory. Interpretation: We identified six potential FEV 1 trajectories, two of which were novel. Three trajectories contributed 75{\%} of COPD burden and were associated with modifiable early-life exposures whose impact was aggravated by adult factors. We postulate that reducing maternal smoking, encouraging immunisation, and avoiding personal smoking, especially in those with smoking parents or low childhood lung function, might minimise COPD risk. Clinicians and patients with asthma should be made aware of the potential long-term implications of non-optimal asthma control for lung function trajectory throughout life, and the role and benefit of optimal asthma control on improving lung function should be investigated in future intervention trials.

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) species were quantified by HPLC-HG-AFS in water and vegetables from a rural area of West Bengal (India). Inorganic species predominated in vegetables (including rice) and drinking water; in fact, inorganic arsenic (i-As) represented more than 80{\%} of the total arsenic (t-As) content. To evaluate i-As intake in an arsenic affected rural village, a food survey was carried out on 129 people (69 men and 60 women). The data from the survey showed that the basic diet, of this rural population, was mainly rice and vegetables, representing more than 50{\%} of their total daily food intake. During the periods when nonvegetarian foods (fish and meat) were scarce, the importance of rice increased, and rice alone represented more than 70{\%} of the total daily food intake. The food analysis and the food questionnaires administrated led us to establish a daily intake of i-As of about 170 microg i-As day (-1), which was above the tolerable daily intake of 150 microg i-As day (-1), generally admitted. Our results clearly demonstrated that food is a very important source of i-As and that this source should never be forgotten in populations depending heavily on vegetables (mainly rice) for their diet.},

	abstract = {Background exposures provide perspective for interpreting calculated health risks associated with naturally occurring substances such as arsenic. Background inorganic arsenic intake from diet and water for children (ages 1-6 years) and all ages of the U.S. population was modeled stochastically using consumption data from USDA, published data on inorganic arsenic in foods, and EPA data on arsenic in drinking water. Mean and 90th percentile intakes for the U.S. population were 5.6 and 10.5 $\mu$g/day, assuming nationwide compliance with the 10 $\mu$g/L U.S. drinking water standard. Intakes for children were slightly lower (3.5 and 5.9 $\mu$g/day). Based on the current EPA cancer slope factor for arsenic, estimated lifetime risks associated with background diet and water at the mean and 90th percentile are 1 per 10,000 and 2 per 10,000, respectively. By comparison, reasonable maximum risks for arsenic in soil at 20 (higher typical background level) and 100 mg/kg are 4 per 100,000 and 2 per 10,000, using EPA default exposure assumptions. EPA reasonable maximum estimates of arsenic exposure from residential use of treated wood are likewise within background intakes. These examples provide context on how predicted risks compare to typical exposures within the U.S. population, thereby providing perspective for risk communication and regulatory decision-making on arsenic in the environment and in consumer products. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Heavy metal toxicity has proven to be a major threat and there are several health risks associated with it. The toxic effects of these metals, even though they do not have any biological role, remain present in some or the other form harmful for the human body and its proper functioning. They sometimes act as a pseudo element of the body while at certain times they may even interfere with metabolic processes. Few metals, such as aluminium, can be removed through elimination activities, while some metals get accumulated in the body and food chain, exhibiting a chronic nature. Various public health measures have been undertaken to control, prevent and treat metal toxicity occurring at various levels, such as occupational exposure, accidents and environmental factors. Metal toxicity depends upon the absorbed dose, the route of exposure and duration of exposure, i.e. acute or chronic. This can lead to various disorders and can also result in excessive damage due to oxidative stress induced by free radical formation. This review gives details about some heavy metals and their toxicity mechanisms, along with their health effects.},

	abstract = {Bacteria isolated from infant feces were immobilized in polysaccharide gel beads (2.5{\%} gellan gum, 0.25{\%} xanthan gum) using a two-phase dispersion process. A 52-day continuous culture was carried out in a single-stage chemostat containing precolonized beads and fed with a medium formulated to approximate the composition of infant chyme. Different dilution rates and pH conditions were tested to simulate the proximal (PCS), transverse (TCS), and distal (DCS) colons. Immobilization preserved all nine bacterial groups tested with survival rates between 3 and 56{\%}. After 1 week fermentation, beads were highly colonized with all populations tested (excepted Staphylococcus spp. present in low numbers), which remained stable throughout the 7.5 weeks of fermentation, with variations below 1 log unit. However, free-cell populations in the circulating liquid medium, produced by immobilized cell growth, cell-release activity from gel beads, and free-cell growth, were altered considerably by culture conditions. Compared to the stabilization period, PCS was characterized by a considerable and rapid increase in Bifidobacterium spp. concentrations (7.4 to 9.6 log CFU/mL), whereas Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Clostridium spp. concentrations decreased and Staphylococcus spp. and coliforms increased during TCS and DCS. Under pseudo-steady-state conditions, the community structure developed in the chemostat reflected the relative proportions of viable bacterial numbers and metabolites generally encountered in infant feces. This work showed that a complex microbiota such as infant fecal bacteria can be immobilized and used in a continuous in vitro intestinal fermentation model to reproduce the high bacterial concentration and bacterial diversity of the feces inoculum, at least at the genera level, with a high stability during long-term experiment.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Dietary intake of specific nutrients or food groups during pregnancy could play a role in the risk of asthma and atopy in offspring, but specific dietary patterns have not been implicated. The authors evaluated the impact of maternal (during pregnancy) and child adherence to a Mediterranean diet on asthma and atopy in childhood. Methods: Women presenting for antenatal care at all general practices in Menorca, a Mediterranean island in Spain, over a 12 month period starting in mid-1997 were recruited. 460 children were included in the analysis after 6.5 years of follow-up. Maternal dietary intake during pregnancy and children's dietary intake at age 6.5 years were assessed by food frequency questionnaires, and adherence to a Mediterranean diet was evaluated by a priori defined scores. During follow-up, parents completed questionnaires on the child's respiratory and allergic symptoms. Children underwent skin prick tests with six common aeroallergens. Results: The prevalence rates of persistent wheeze, atopic wheeze and atopy at age 6.5 years were 13.2{\%}, 5.8{\%} and 17.0{\%}, respectively. One-third (36.1{\%}) of mothers had a low quality Mediterranean diet during pregnancy according to the Mediterranean Diet Score, while the rest had a high score. A high Mediterranean Diet Score during pregnancy (at two levels, using "low" score as the reference) was found to be protective for persistent wheeze (OR 0.22; 95{\%} CI 0.08 to 0.58), atopic wheeze (OR 0.30; 95{\%} CI 0.10 to 0.90) and atopy (OR 0.55; 95{\%} CI 0.31 to 0.97) at age 6.5 years after adjusting for potential confounders. Childhood adherence to a Mediterranean diet was negatively associated with persistent wheeze and atopy although the associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: These results support a protective effect of a high level of adherence to a Mediterranean diet during pregnancy against asthma-like symptoms and atopy in childhood.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers are the major causes of chronic arsenic exposure-related morbidity and mortality. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs and cancers. This study has been designed to evaluate the interactions of arsenic exposure with serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations especially in relation to the circulating biomarkers of CVDs. METHODS: A total of 373 human subjects, 265 from arsenic-endemic and 108 from non-endemic areas in Bangladesh were recruited for this study. Arsenic concentrations in the specimens were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and serum MMPs were quantified by immunoassay kits. RESULTS: Serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations in arsenic-endemic population were significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher than those in non-endemic population. Both MMPs showed significant positive interactions with drinking water (r s = 0.208, p {\textless} 0.001 for MMP-2; r s = 0.163, p {\textless} 0.01 for MMP-9), hair (r s = 0.163, p {\textless} 0.01 for MMP-2; r s = 0.173, p {\textless} 0.01 for MMP-9) and nail (r s = 0.160, p {\textless} 0.01 for MMP-2; r s = 0.182, p {\textless} 0.001 for MMP-9) arsenic of the study subjects. MMP-2 concentrations were 1.02, 1.03 and 1.05 times, and MMP-9 concentrations were 1.03, 1.06 and 1.07 times greater for 1 unit increase in log-transformed water, hair and nail arsenic concentrations, respectively, after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, BMI, smoking habit and hypertension). Furthermore, both MMPs were increased dose-dependently when the study subjects were split into three ({\textless}/=10, 10.1-50 and {\textgreater} 50 mug/L) groups based on the regulatory upper limit of water arsenic concentration set by WHO and Bangladesh Government. MMPs were also found to be significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) associated with each other. Finally, the concentrations of both MMPs were correlated with several circulating markers related to CVDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the significant positive associations and dose-response relationships of arsenic exposure with serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations. This study also showed the interactions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 concentrations with the circulating markers of CVDs suggesting the MMP-2 and MMP-9 -mediated mechanism of arsenic-induced CVDs.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland. Several agricultural fields show high contents of arsenic because of irrigation with arsenic-contaminated groundwater. Vegetables accumulate arsenic in their edible parts when grown in contaminated soils. Polluted vegetables are one of the main sources of arsenic in the food chain, especially for people living in rural arsenic endemic villages of India and Bangladesh. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of floriculture in the crop rotation system of arsenic endemic areas of the Bengal Delta. The effects of different arsenic concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg As L {\textless} sup {\textgreater} −1 {\textless} /sup {\textgreater} ) and types of flowering plant (Gomphrena globosa and Zinnia elegans) on plant growth and arsenic accumulation were studied under hydroponic conditions. Total arsenic was quantified using atomic absorption spectrometer with hydride generation (HG-AAS). Arsenic was mainly accumulated in the roots (72 {\%}), followed by leaves (12 {\%}), stems (10 {\%}), and flowers ( {\textless} 1 {\%}). The flowering plants studied did not show as high phytoremediation capacities as other wild species, such as ferns. However, they behaved as arsenic tolerant plants and grew and bloomed well, without showing any phytotoxic signs. This study proves that floriculture could be included within the crop rotation system in arsenic-contaminated agricultural soils, in order to improve food safety and also food security by increasing farmer's revenue.},

We measured content of fifteen trace elements (antimony, barium, beryllium, boron, cobalt, lithium, molybdenum, nickel, silver, strontium, tellurium, thallium, titanium, uranium, and vanadium) in 908 food and beverage samples through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. We estimated their dietary intake using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire collected from a population of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern Italy. We compared our estimates with tolerable upper intake levels reported by international agencies and we assessed the non-carcinogenic risk through calculation of total hazard quotient for each trace element according to the US-EPA approach. Overall, estimates of their dietary intake were substantially similar to those reported from other countries, and they fell below the tolerable upper intake levels provided by international agencies. The total hazard quotient for each trace element was below 1. Our findings provide updated estimates of food levels and dietary intake of trace elements far frequently evaluated in a sample of Italian adult consumers. They also suggest that any non-carcinogenic risk associated with intake of investigated trace elements may be ruled out in our population.},

	abstract = {Epidemiologic studies conducted in the US have not previously detected an association between regional drinking water arsenic concentrations and corresponding cancer occurrence or mortality rates. To improve our estimation of cancer risk and arsenic exposure in the USA, we have investigated the reliability of several exposure markers. In the current study, we specifically evaluated the long-term reproducibility of tap water and toenail concentrations of arsenic, and the relation between water, toenail, and urinary measurement. Subjects included 99 controls in our case-control study on whom we requested a household tap water sample and toenail clipping three to five years apart. Additionally, participants were asked to provide a first morning void sample at the second interview. Tap water arsenic concentrations ranged from undetectable ({\textless}0.01 microg/L) to 66.6 microg/L. We found a significant correlation between both replicate water and toenail samples (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.79-0.89 for water, and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.60, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.48-0.70 for toenails). The inter-method correlations for water, urinary and toenail arsenic were all statistically significant (r = 0.35, p = 0.0024 for urine vs water; r = 0.33, p = 0.0016 for toenail vs water and r = 0.36, p = 0.0012 for urine vs toenails). Thus, we found both toenail and water measurements of arsenic reproducible over a three- to five-year period. Our data suggest that biologic markers may provide reliable estimates of internal dose of low level arsenic exposure that can be used to assess cancer risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Arsenic poisoning is a public health problem worldwide. A few studies have reported the effects of arsenic exposure on adult cognitive function, but with limitations in the subject selection and exposure markers. Moreover, information regarding the association between arsenic exposure and biomarker of cognitive impairment is scarce. Objectives: We examined the associations between arsenic exposure and adult cognitive impairment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potential biomarker of cognitive health status. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study that recruited 693 adult (18--60 years old) subjects from the areas of low- and high‑arsenic exposure in rural Bangladesh. The subjects' arsenic exposure levels (drinking water, hair, and nail arsenic concentrations) were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. The Bangla version of the MMSE was used as a cognitive assessment tool. Serum BDNF (sBDNF) levels were assessed by immunoassay. Results: In this study, we found that average MMSE score and sBDNF level of the subjects in arsenic-endemic areas were significantly (p {\textless} 0.001 for both) lower than those of the subjects in non-endemic area. Our analyses revealed that both MMSE scores and sBDNF levels were decreased with the increasing concentrations of arsenic in drinking water, hair, and nails in a dose-dependent fashion. In regression analyses, significant associations of arsenic exposure metrics with MMSE scores and sBDNF levels were observed even after adjustment for several variables. Intriguingly, MMSE scores showed a significantly positive correlation with sBDNF levels. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to arsenic dose-dependently decreases cognitive function in adults, with a concomitant reduction of sBDNF levels. A decreased BDNF level may be part of the biochemical basis of chronic arsenic exposure-related cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring metalloid that poses a significant human cancer risk. While water consumption provides the majority of human exposure, millions of individuals worldwide are significantly exposed to arsenic through naturally occurring levels of arsenic in grains, vegetables, meats and fish, as well as through food processed with water containing arsenic. Thus, we estimated the global burdens of disease for bladder, lung, and skin cancers attributable to inorganic arsenic in food.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: To determine foodborne inorganic arsenic exposures worldwide, we used World Health Organization estimates of food consumption in thirteen country clusters, in conjunction with reported measurements of total and inorganic arsenic in different foods. We estimated slope factors for arsenic-related bladder and lung cancers, and used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency skin cancer slope factor, to calculate the annual risk of the cancer incidence in males and females within each country cluster.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We estimated that each year 9,129 to 119,176 additional cases of bladder cancer, 11,844 to 121,442 of lung cancer, and 10,729 to 110,015 of skin cancer worldwide are attributable to inorganic arsenic in food.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These estimates indicate that foodborne arsenic exposure causes a significant global burden of human disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPACT: Estimating the global cancer burden caused by arsenic exposure in food will support policies that reduce exposure to disease-promoting environmental hazards.

	abstract = {This study assessed the association between cadmium exposure and neuropsychological development in children from a region with high industrial and mining activities in southwestern Spain. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 261 children aged 6--9 years between January and March 2012. Cadmium exposure was measured in urine and hair of children, and neuropsychological development was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and with three computerized tests from the Behavioral Assessment and Research System (BARS): Reaction Time Test (RTT), Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Selective Attention Test (SAT). Multivariate linear regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate the association between neuropsychological development and cadmium exposure measured in urine and hair samples. Geometric means of urine and hair cadmium levels were 0.75$\mu$g/g creatinine and 0.01$\mu$g/g, respectively. We observed that doubling of levels of cadmium in urine was associated with a reduction of two points (95{\%} CI: −3.8 to −0.4) in the Full-Scale intelligence quotient (IQ) in boys. By domains, association was statistically significant for Verbal Comprehension ($\beta$=−2.0; p=0.04) and close to the significance level for Perceptual Reasoning ($\beta$=−1.8; p=0.06). Among girls, only Verbal Comprehension showed suggestive associations with cadmium exposure ($\beta$=−1.7; p=0.06). Cadmium exposure is associated with cognitive delays in boys in our region. Our results provide additional evidence of the neurotoxic effect of low-level postnatal cadmium exposure among children, and support the hypothesis of differences between sexes in the neurotoxic effect of metals on children.},

	abstract = {Blood mercury and urinary arsenic levels are more than fivefold greater in the Korean population compared with those of the United States. This may be related to the foods people consumed. Therefore, we examined the associations between food categories and mercury and arsenic exposure in the Korean adult population. Data regarding nutritional, biochemical, and health-related parameters were obtained from a cross-sectional study, the 2008-2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (3,404 men and women age ≥ 20 years). The log-transformed blood mercury and urinary arsenic levels were regressed against the frequency tertiles of each food group after covariate adjustment for sex, age, residence area, education level, smoking status, and drinking status using food-frequency data. Blood mercury levels in the high consumption groups compared to the low consumption groups were elevated by about 20 percents with salted fish, shellfish, whitefish, bluefish, and alcohol, and by about 9-14 percents with seaweeds, green vegetables, fruits and tea, whereas rice did not affect blood mercury levels. Urinary arsenic levels were markedly increased with consumption of rice, bluefish, salted fish, shellfish, whitefish, and seaweed, whereas they were moderately increased with consumption of grains, green and white vegetables, fruits, coffee, and alcohol. The remaining food categories tended to lower these levels only minimally. In conclusion, the typical Asian diet, which is high in rice, salted fish, shellfish, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, and tea, may be associated with greater blood mercury and urinary arsenic levels. This study suggests that mercury and arsenic contents should be monitored and controlled in soil and water used for agriculture to decrease health risks from heavy-metal contamination.},

	abstract = {This study concerns the metabolism of inorganic arsenic (As) in children in three villages in northern Argentina: San Antonio de los Cobres and Taco Pozo, each with about 200 microg As/l in the drinking water, and Rosario de Lerma, with 0.65 microg As/l. Findings show that the concentrations of As in the blood and urine of the children in the two As-rich villages were on average 9 and 380 microg/l, respectively, the highest ever recorded for children. The concentrations were about 10 and 30 times higher for blood and urine, respectively, than in Rosario de Lerma. Total As in urine was only slightly higher than the sum of metabolites of inorganic As (U-Asmet), i.e., inorganic As, methylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA); this shows that inorganic As was the main form of As ingested. In contrast to previous studies on urinary metabolites of inorganic As in various population groups, the children and women in the present study excreted very little MMA. Thus, there seems to be a polymorphism for the enzymes (methyltransferases) involved in the methylation of As. Interestingly, the children had a significantly higher percentage of inorganic As in urine than the women, about 50{\%} versus 32{\%}. Also, the percentage of inorganic As in the children is considerably higher than in previous studies on children (about 13{\%} in the two studies available) and adults (about 15-25{\%}) in other population groups. This may indicate that children are more sensitive to As-induced toxicity than adults, as the methylated metabolites bind less to tissue constituents than inorganic As. In the children, the percentage inorganic arsenic in urine decreased, and the percentage of DMA increased with increasing U-Asmet, indicating an induction of As methylation with increasing exposure.},

	abstract = {The relationship of exposure and tissue concentration of parent chemical and metabolites over prolonged exposure is a critical issue for chronic toxicities mediated by metabolite(s) rather than parent chemical alone. This is an issue for AsV because its trivalent metabolites have unique toxicities and relatively greater potency compared to their pentavalent counterparts for many endpoints. In this study, dose-dependency in tissue distribution and urinary excretion for inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites was assessed in female C57Bl/6 mice exposed to 0, 0.5, 2, 10 or 50 ppm arsenic (as arsenate, AsV) in their drinking water for 12 weeks. No adverse effects were observed and body weight gain did not differ significantly among groups. Urinary excretion of arsenite monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII), dimethylarsinous acid (DMAIII), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV), and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) increased linearly with dose, whereas AsV and monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV) excretion was non-linear with respect to dose. Total tissue arsenic accumulation was greatest in kidney {\textgreater} lung {\textgreater} urinary bladder ⋙ skin {\textgreater} blood {\textgreater} liver. Monomethyl arsenic (MMA, i.e. MMAIII + MMAV) was the predominant metabolite in kidney, whereas dimethylarsenic (DMA, i.e., DMAIII + DMAV) was the predominant metabolite in lung. Urinary bladder tissue had roughly equivalent levels of inorganic arsenic and dimethylarsenic, as did skin. These data indicate that pharmacokinetic models for arsenic metabolism and disposition need to include mechanisms for organ-specific accumulation of some arsenicals and that urinary metabolite profiles are not necessarily reflective of target tissue dosimetry.},

Results Compared to adults never exposed {\textgreater}??10????g/L, adults born in Antofagasta during the high exposure period had elevated odds ratios (OR) of respiratory symptoms (e.g., OR for shortness of breath??=??5.56, 90{\%} confidence interval (CI): 2.68???11.5), and decreases in pulmonary function (e.g., 224??mL decrease in forced vital capacity in nonsmokers, 90{\%} CI: 97???351??mL). Subjects with long-term exposure to arsenic water concentrations near 60????g/L also had increases in some pulmonary symptoms and reduced lung function. Conclusions Overall, these findings provide new evidence that in utero or childhood arsenic exposure is associated with non-malignant pulmonary disease in adults. They also provide preliminary new evidence that long-term exposures to moderate levels of arsenic may be associated with lung toxicity, although the magnitude of these latter findings were greater than expected and should be confirmed.},

	abstract = {Methods A longitudinal cohort study beginning in early pregnancy was conducted in rural Bangladesh, where arsenic concentrations in well water vary considerably. We assessed the effects of pre- and postnatal arsenic exposure on development of 2112 children at 18 months of age with Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (mental and psychomotor development indices), Wolke's Behavior Rating Scale and maternal report of language. We related the measures of child development to arsenic concentrations in maternal urine in gestational weeks 9 and 30 and child's urinary arsenic at 18 months of age. Details of socio-economic background, home stimulation and anthropometric measurements of mothers and children were also available. Results Median maternal urinary arsenic concentration averaged over early and late gestation was 96 mu g/l, whereas children's urine contained 35 mu g/l of arsenic. There was no significant effect of any of the arsenic exposure measures on any of the child development measures after controlling for social and economic confounders, child's age and sex. Conclusion Contrary to expectations, we found no indications of adverse effects of pre- or postnatal arsenic exposure on child development at 18 months. It remains possible that duration of exposure is critical and that effects will become apparent later in childhood.},

Dioscorides, a Greek physician from the 1st century CE, pharmacist and botanist who wrote a 5 volume Pharmacopeia entitled
``De Materia Medica'' which was actively used in medicine for almost 1500 years was the first to described arsenic. He described it as
a poison in the first century since it possessed ideal properties for menacing and/or lethal activities. These properties included lack of
color, odor or taste when mixed in food or drink, effective at very small doses thus making its transport quite simple and its
prevalence which made it readily available to all classes of society. First and foremost, arsenic was a handy and almost perfect
poison. The word ``arsenic'' has several derivations including from the Syriac word (al) zarniqa ()L {\{}

zarnikh, (زرنيـــخ (and the Greek word arsenikon (Αrsenikόn). It is also related to the similar Greek word arsenikos (ΑrsenikόB),
meaning ``masculine'' or ``potent.'' The word ``arsenic'' has subsequently been adopted into Latin as arsenicum and then ultimately
into both French and English as arsenic.
Arsenic compounds were mined by the early Chinese, Greek and Egyptian civilizations who found it could be produced from its
ores easily which made it one of the first recognized as an element by early alchemists. Alchemy existed from about 500 BCE to

	abstract = {Background: The evaluation of the chemical impact on human health is usually constrained to the analysis of the health effects of exposure to a single chemical or a group of similar chemicals at one time. The effects of chemical mixtures are seldom analyzed. In this study, we applied three statistical models to assess the association between the exposure to a mixture of seven xenobiotics (three phthalate metabolites, two phenols, and two pesticides) and obesity. Methods: Urinary levels of environmental phenols, pesticides, and phthalate metabolites were measured in adults who participated in the U.S.-based National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2013 to 2014. Body examination was conducted to determine obesity. We fitted multivariable models, using generalized linear (here both logistic and linear) regression, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models to estimate the association between chemical exposures and obesity. Results: Of 1269 individuals included in our final analysis, 38.5{\%} had general obesity and 58.0{\%} had abdominal obesity. In the logistic regression model established for each single chemical, bisphenol S (BPS), mono (carboxyoctyl) phthalate (MCOP), and mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) were associated with both general and abdominal obesity (fourth vs. first quartile). In linear regression, MCOP was associated with BMI and waist circumference. In WQS regression analysis, the WQS index was significantly associated with both general obesity (OR = 1.63, 95{\%} CI: 1.21--2.20) and abdominal obesity (OR = 1.66, 95{\%} CI: 1.18--2.34). MCOP, bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), and mono ethyl phthalate (MEP) were the most heavily weighing chemicals. In BKMR analysis, the overall effect of mixture was significantly associated with general obesity when all the chemicals were at their 60th percentile or above it, compared to all of them at their 50th percentile. MCOP, BPA, and BPS showed positive trends. By contrast, MECPP showed a flat and modest inverse trend. Conclusion: When comparing results from these three models, MCOP, BPA, and BPS were identified as the most important factors associated with obesity. We recommend estimating the joint effects of chemical mixtures by applying diverse statistical methods and interpreting their results together, considering their advantages and disadvantages.},

Total urinary arsenic was analyzed in 489 pairs of urine samples, corresponding to the 12th and 32th weeks of pregnancy. Association of arsenic content with seafood and other dietary items were studied. Geometric mean concentrations were 34 and 37 $\mu$g/g creatinine during the first and third trimesters, respectively. The observed concentrations were similar to those reported in studies from other Mediterranean countries. The differences between both periods were not statistically significant. The only dietary factor significantly and positively associated with total urinary arsenic in both series of samples was seafood, particularly lean fish. Moreover, lean fish consumption during both periods was found to be the main determinant for differences in levels of arsenic between the first and third trimesters, which confirms the association between high levels of total urinary arsenic and seafood consumption.},

	abstract = {Arsenic concentrations greater than 100 µg/L in drinking water are a known cause of cancer, but the risks associated with lower concentrations are less well understood. The unusual geology and good information on past exposure found in northern Chile are key advantages for investigating the potential long-term effects of arsenic. We performed a case-control study of lung cancer from 2007 to 2010 in areas of northern Chile that had a wide range of arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Previously, we reported evidence of elevated cancer risks at arsenic concentrations greater than 100 µg/L. In the present study, we restricted analyses to the 92 cases and 288 population-based controls who were exposed to concentrations less than 100 µg/L. After adjustment for age, sex, and smoking behavior, these exposures from 40 or more years ago resulted in odds ratios for lung cancer of 1.00, 1.43 (90{\%} confidence interval: 0.82, 2.52), and 2.01 (90{\%} confidence interval: 1.14, 3.52) for increasing tertiles of arsenic exposure , respectively (P for trend = 0.02). Mean arsenic water concentrations in these tertiles were 6.5, 23.0, and 58.6 µg/L. For subjects younger than 65 years of age, the corresponding odds ratios were 1.00, 1.62 (90{\%} confidence interval: 0.67, 3.90), and 3.41 (90{\%} confidence interval: 1.51, 7.70). Adjustments for occupation, fruit and vegetable intake, and socioeconomic status had little impact on the results. These findings provide new evidence that arsenic water concentrations less than 100 µg/L are associated with higher risks of lung cancer. arsenic; case-control; drinking water; low exposure; lung cancer; northern Chile Abbreviation: CI, confidence interval. High concentrations of arsenic in drinking water (e.g., {\textgreater}100 µg/L) are known to cause cancer, but the risks associated with exposure to lower concentrations are unclear (1-3). One difficulty in studying low-level exposures is the prolonged latency of arsenic-caused cancer (2, 4-6). This long latency period means that exposure data must be available for a period of several decades or more in order to identify true overall risks. Another difficulty is that exposure in most arsenic-exposed areas comes from thousands of small private wells, for which historic records are frequently unavailable (7). Northern Chile is the driest habitable place on earth. There are few water sources, and almost everyone lives in a city and drinks water from municipal supplies. These supplies have had a wide range of arsenic concentrations, and historical records are available from 40 years ago or more (8). These factors mean that a person's lifetime exposure can be reliably estimated simply by knowing the cities in which the person lived. In 2007-2010, we performed a case-control study in northern Chile and identified high odds ratios for lung, bladder, and kidney cancers (6, 9). These results focused on cities in which arsenic concentrations in drinking water were greater than 800 µg/L. They also involved lifetime average and cumulative exposure metrics, in which short periods of higher exposures can be diluted by longer periods of lower exposure. In the present study, we focused on long-term lower exposures and investigated lung cancer, the most common arsenic-related cause of death (10).},

	abstract = {Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient for most living organisms, including humans. Cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) are the major dietary source of Mo. However, little is known about the genetic basis of the variation in Mo content in rice grain. We mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qGMo8 that controls Mo accumulation in rice grain by using a recombinant inbred line population and a backcross introgression line population. We identified a molybdate transporter, OsMOT1;1, as the causal gene for this QTL. OsMOT1;1 exhibits transport activity for molybdate, but not sulfate, when heterogeneously expressed in yeast cells. OsMOT1;1 is mainly expressed in roots and is involved in the uptake and translocation of molybdate under molybdate-limited condition. Knockdown of OsMOT1;1 results in less Mo being translocated to shoots, lower Mo concentration in grains and higher sensitivity to Mo deficiency. We reveal that the natural variation of Mo concentration in rice grains is attributed to the variable expression of OsMOT1;1 due to sequence variation in its promoter. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsMOT1;1 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with Mo-enriched grain for dietary needs and improve Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Inadequate stores or intakes of essential minerals in pregnancy, or too high exposure to both toxic and essential elements, can have adverse effects on mother and child. The main aims of this study were to 1) describe the concentrations and patterns of essential and toxic elements measured in maternal whole blood during pregnancy; 2) identify dietary, lifestyle and sociodemographic determinants of element status; and 3) explore the impact of iron deficiency on blood element concentrations. METHODS This study is based on blood samples collected from 2982 women in gestational week 18 in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa) which were analyzed as part of the Norwegian Environmental Biobank. We derived blood element patterns by exploratory factor analysis, and associations between blood element patterns and diet were explored using sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression. RESULTS Blood concentrations were determined for the essential elements (in the order of most abundant) Zn {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Se {\textgreater} Mn {\textgreater} Mo {\textgreater} Co, and the toxic metals Pb {\textgreater} As {\textgreater} Hg {\textgreater} Cd {\textgreater} Tl. The concentrations were in ranges that were similar to or sometimes more favorable than in other pregnant and non-pregnant European women. We identified two blood element patterns; one including Zn, Se and Mn and another including Hg and As. For the Zn-Se-Mn pattern, use of multimineral supplements was the most important dietary determinant, while a high score in the Hg-As pattern was mainly determined by seafood consumption. Concentrations of Mn, Cd and Co were significantly higher in women with iron deficiency (plasma ferritin {\textless} 12 $\mu$g/L) than in women with plasma ferritin ≥ 12 $\mu$g/L. CONCLUSION Our study illustrates complex relationships and coexistence of essential and toxic elements. Their potential interplay adds to the challenges of studies investigating health effects related to either diet or toxicants.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic intake in 969 men and women and methylmercury intake in 785 men and women from across the United States were assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, in combination with a database for the content of those elements in foods, and by toenail concentrations of arsenic and mercury. In addition, empirical weights for foods on the dietary questionnaire were derived from multivariate regression models to estimate associations between diet and toenail arsenic and mercury levels, independent of the assumptions about inorganic arsenic and methylmercury in foods, which are based upon limited residue measurements. The use of empirical weights significantly improved the correlation of arsenic consumption with toenail arsenic levels (r = 0.33, P = 0.0001), compared with the weak correlation obtained using the food residue method to calculate intake (r = 0.15, P = 0.0001). Mercury consumption computed using empirical weights yielded a significant correlation with toenail arsenic (r = 0.42, P = 0.001), similar to the correlation using energy-adjusted intake calculated from food residue tables (r = 0.35, P = 0.001). These results illustrate the potential use of empirically derived weights for foods in estimating toenail levels of selected heavy metals and support the validity of published food residue data that are used to estimate mercury consumption.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Biomonitoring studies have shown that children are constantly exposed to complex patterns of chemical and nonchemical exposures. Here, we briefly summarize the rationale for studying multiple exposures, also called mixture, in relation to child health and key statistical approaches that can be used. We discuss advantages over traditional methods, limitations and appropriateness of the context. RECENT FINDINGS: New approaches allow pediatric researchers to answer increasingly complex questions related to environmental mixtures. We present methods to identify the most relevant exposures among a high-multitude of variables, via shrinkage and variable selection techniques, and identify the overall mixture effect, via Weighted Quantile Sum and Bayesian Kernel Machine regressions. We then describe novel extensions that handle high-dimensional exposure data and allow identification of critical exposure windows. SUMMARY: Recent advances in statistics and machine learning enable researchers to identify important mixture components, estimate joint mixture effects and pinpoint critical windows of exposure. Despite many advantages over single chemical approaches, measurement error and biases may be amplified in mixtures research, requiring careful study planning and design. Future research requires increased collaboration between epidemiologists, statisticians and data scientists, and further integration with causal inference methods.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Although it is widely assumed that the incidence of childhood respiratory allergies to common aeroallergens is directly related to allergen exposure in early life, few longitudinal studies have investigated this issue, and available data are scarce and mainly limited to high-risk groups. Objectives: To assess, in a prospective manner and in a general population, the role of early life exposures to Der p1 and Fel d1 on the inception of sensitization and asthma. Methods: Pregnant women and their children were recruited for the Asthma Multicentre Infant Cohort Study. Overall, 1,611 newborns were initially enrolled in three cohorts in the United Kingdom and Spain. Der p1 and Fel d1 allergens were measured in household dust samples at 3 months of age for 1,474 (91.5{\%}) participants, and skin prick tests were performed at 6 years of age on 1,182 (80.2{\%}) participants. Wheeze and diagnosed asthma were reported in yearly questionnaires. Measurements and Main Results: Exposure to Der p1 early in life was not related to a positive specific prick test or to asthma or persistent wheeze at 6 years of age. Fel d1 showed an association with all these outcomes (third vs. first tertile; odds ratio, 4.43 for positive specific prick test and 2.6 for diagnosed asthma). Conclusions: Dose-response relationships between allergen exposure and sensitization or asthma may be allergen specific and nonlinear; a minimum threshold level is needed to induce sensitization, but no dose-response relationship exists above this level. The effect of a particular allergen seems to be similar on atopy and asthma inception.},

Keeping in view the FFA content, oil yield, visible oil quality, moisture and protein content; treatment combination of 4W/g+5min was found to be optimum in stabilizing the treated rice bran. The bran stabilized by optimized microwave treatment and bran obtained using traditional parboiling stabilization process (Sela) was compared. Microwave treated rice bran could be stored safely for a period of three months without any loss of nutritional quality as well as with high oil quality (FFA -- 3{\%}, PV -- 7.63meq/kg, TBA -- 0.071mg MDA/kg). The oil yield from the parboiled rice bran is significantly higher (23{\%}) than microwave treated rice bran (21{\%}).},

	abstract = {Arsenic toxicity is a global health problem affecting many millions of people. The main source of exposure is drinking water contaminated by natural geological sources. Current risk assessment is based on the recognized carcinogenicity of arsenic, but neurotoxic risks have been overlooked. In 1955, an outbreak of arsenic poisoning occurred among Japanese infants, with more than 100 deaths. The source was contaminated milk powder produced by the Morinaga company. Detailed accounts of the Morinaga dried milk poisoning were published in Japanese only, and an overview of this poisoning incident and its long-term consequences is therefore presented. From analyses available, the arsenic concentration in milk made from the Morinaga milk powder is calculated to be about 4--7 mg/L, corresponding to daily doses slightly above 500 $\mu$g/kg body weight. Lower exposures would result from using diluted milk. Clinical poisoning cases occurred after a few weeks of exposure, with a total dose of about 60 mg. This experience provides clear-cut evidence for hazard assessment of the developmental neurotoxicity. At the present time, more than 600 surviving victims, now in their 50s, have been reported to suffer from severe sequelae, such as mental retardation, neurological diseases, and other disabilities. Along with more recent epidemiological studies of children with environmental arsenic exposures, the data amply demonstrate the need to consider neurotoxicity as a key concern in risk assessment of inorganic arsenic exposure.},

@article{Kubachka2009,
	abstract = {Although metabolism of arsenicals to form methylated oxoarsenical species has been extensively studied, less is known about the formation of thiolated arsenical species that have recently been detected as urinary metabolites. Indeed, their presence suggests that the metabolism of ingested arsenic is more complex than previously thought. Recent reports have shown that thiolated arsenicals can be produced by the anaerobic microflora of the mouse cecum, suggesting that metabolism prior to systemic absorption may be a significant determinant of the pattern and extent of exposure to various arsenic-containing species. Here, we examined the metabolism of 34S labeled dimethylthioarsinic acid (34S-DMTA(V)) by the anaerobic microflora of the mouse cecum using HPLC-ICP-MS and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS to monitor for the presence of various oxo- and thioarsenicals. The use of isotopically enriched 34S-DMTA(V) made it possible to differentiate among potential metabolic pathways for production of the trimethylarsine sulfide (TMAS(V)). Upon in vitro incubation in an assay containing anaerobic microflora of mouse cecum, 34S-DMTA(V) underwent several transformations. Labile 34S was exchanged with more abundant 32S to produce 32S-DMTA(V), a thiol group was added to yield DMDTA(V), and a methyl group was added to yield 34S-TMAS(V). Because incubation of 34S-DMTA(V) resulted in the formation of 34S-TMAS(V), the pathway for its formation must preserve the arsenic-sulfur bond. The alternative metabolic pathway postulated for formation of TMAS(V) from dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) would proceed via a dimethylarsinous acid (DMA(III)) intermediate and would necessitate the loss of 34S label. Structural confirmation of the metabolic product was achieved using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The data presented support the direct methylation of DMTA(V) to TMAS(V). Additionally, the detection of isotopically pure 34S-TMAS(V) raises questions about the sulfur exchange properties of TMAS(V) in the cecum material. Therefore, 34S-TMAS(V) was incubated and the exchange was monitored with respect to time. The data suggest that the As-S bond associated with TMAS(V) is less labile than the As-S bond associated with DMTA(V).},

A large number of chemicals have been identified as endocrine disruptors and humans can be exposed to them either due to their occupations or through dietary and environmental exposure (water, soil and air). Endocrine disrupting chemicals are compounds that alter the normal functioning of the endocrine system of both humans and wildlife. In order to understand the vulnerability and risk factors of people due to endocrine disruptors as well as the remedies for these, methods need to be developed in order to predict effects on populations and communities from the knowledge of effects on individuals. For several years there have been a growing interest on the mechanism and effect of endocrine disruptors and their relation with environment and human health effect. This paper, based on extensive literature survey, briefly studies the progress mainly in human to provide information concerning causative substances, mechanism of action, ubiquity of effects and important issues related to endocrine disruptors. It also reviews the current knowledge of the potential impacts of endocrine disruptors on human health so that the effects can be known and remedies applied for the problem as soon as possible.},

	abstract = {Background: Metal exposure is a public health hazard due to neurocognitive effects starting in early life. Poor socio-economic status, adverse home and family environment can enhance the neurodevelopmental toxicity due to chemical exposure. Disadvantaged socio-economic conditions are generally higher in environmentally impacted areas although the combined effect of these two factors has not been sufficiently studied. Methods: The effect of co-exposure to neurotoxic metals including arsenic, cadmium, manganese, mercury, lead, selenium, and to socio-economic stressors was assessed in a group of 299 children aged 6-12 years, residing at incremental distance from industrial emissions in Taranto, Italy. Exposure was assessed with biological monitoring and the distance between the home address and the exposure point source. Children's cognitive functions were examined using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Linear mixed models were chosen to assess the association between metal exposure, socio-economic status and neurocognitive outcomes. Results: Urinary arsenic, cadmium and hair manganese resulted inversely related to the distance from the industrial emission source ($\beta$ - 0.04; 95{\%} CI -0.06, - 0.01; $\beta$ - 0.02; 95{\%} CI -0.05, - 0.001; $\beta$ - 0.02 95{\%} CI -0.05, - 0.003) while the WISC intellectual quotient and its sub-scores (except processing speed index) showed a positive association with distance. Blood lead and urinary cadmium were negatively associated with the IQ total score and all sub-scores, although not reaching the significance level. Hair manganese and blood lead was positively associated with the CANTAB between errors of spatial working memory ($\beta$ 2.2; 95{\%} CI 0.3, 3.9) and the reaction time of stop signal task ($\beta$ 0.05; 95{\%} CI 0.02, 0.1) respectively. All the other CANTAB neurocognitive tests did not show to be significantly influenced by metal exposure. The highest socio-economic status showed about five points intellectual quotient more than the lowest level on average ($\beta$ 4.8; 95{\%} CI 0.3, 9.6); the interaction term between blood lead and the socio-economic status showed a significant negative impact of lead on working memory at the lowest socio-economic status level ($\beta$ - 4.0; 95{\%} CI -6.9, - 1.1). Conclusions: Metal exposure and the distance from industrial emission was associated with negative cognitive impacts in these children. Lead exposure had neurocognitive effect even at very low levels of blood lead concentration when socio-economic status is low, and this should further address the importance and prioritize preventive and regulatory interventions.},

@article{Turner2008,
	abstract = {Background: A study was undertaken to examine factors that might influence lung function during infancy and to test the hypothesis that change in weight during infancy is negatively associated with change in lung function. Methods: Weight, length and maximal flow at functional residual capacity (V′maxFRC) were measured at ages 1 and 12 months. V′maxFRC was adjusted for length. Asthma symptoms and age at introduction of formula feeds were identified from questionnaires. Groups were dichotomised by V′maxFRC at 1 month and change in V′maxFRC. Results: 154 infants were assessed at ages 1 and 12 months. The change in V′maxFRC was inversely associated with change in weight (r = -0.18, r2 = 0.13, p{\textless}0.001). The group with lower V′maxFRC at 1 month and reduced change in V′maxFRC over infancy had the greatest weight gain (p = 0.003) and increased risk for asthma symptoms by 3 years (p = 0.017) but not afterwards. Exclusive breast feeding to 6 months was associated with a mean reduction in weight gain at age 12 months in comparison with earlier introduction of formula milk (mean difference 0.65 kg, p = 0.001), and was also associated with reduced asthma symptoms at 3 years (odds ratio 0.44, p = 0.043) but not at 6 or 11 years of age. Conclusions: Weight gain in infancy is inversely associated with change in lung function during infancy. Postnatal weight gain may be indirectly associated with early transient asthma symptoms via an influence on lung growth during infancy, and this is potentially modifiable by breast feeding. These associations could be relevant to the clinically recognised syndrome of the "fat happy wheezer".},

@article{Martinez2009,
	abstract = {Results from birth cohort and cross-sectional studies of young children with wheezing have uncovered strong associations between both lung function and immune responses in early life and the subsequent development of persistent wheezing and chronic airway obstruction up to mid-adulthood. It is now apparent that the pattern of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, deficits in lung function, and structural airway remodeling that are characteristic of asthma may be already established during the preschool years in most patients. Interactions between acute viral infections, especially those due to rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, and exposure to perennial aeroallergens may induce persistent alterations in immune responses and airway function in susceptible subjects. Similarly, deficits in airway function present shortly after birth predict airflow limitation in early adult life, which in turn is a strong predisposing factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The fact that these alterations are more likely to occur during early life and even in utero than later during childhood suggests that there a developmental window of susceptibility during which exposures can disrupt normal growth trajectories. Novel strategies for primary prevention of chronic respiratory diseases will be based on the identification of the genetic and environmental factors that interactively cause these disruptions.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a known carcinogen specifically linked to skin cancer occurrence in regions with highly contaminated drinking water or in individuals who took arsenic-containing medicines. Presently, it is unknown whether such effects occur at environmental levels found in the United States. To address this question, the authors used data collected on 587 basal cell and 284 squamous cell skin cancer cases and 524 controls interviewed as part of a case-control study conducted in New Hampshire between 1993 and 1996. Arsenic was determined in toenail clippings using instrumental neutron activation analysis. The odds ratios for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were close to unity in all but the highest category. Among individuals with toenail arsenic concentrations above the 97th percentile, the adjusted odds ratios were 2.07 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.92, 4.66) for SCC and 1.44 (95{\%} CI: 0.74, 2.81) for BCC, compared with those with concentrations at or below the median. While the risks of SCC and BCC did not appear elevated at the toenail arsenic concentrations detected in most study subjects, the authors cannot exclude the possibility of a dose-related increase at the highest levels of exposure experienced in the New Hampshire population.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

This study evaluated the classification and stage of bladder cancers as part of a population-based epidemiological study of bladder cancer in the Northeastern United States.|All New Hampshire residents with bladder cancer newly diagnosed from 1998 to 2000 were identified through the state cancer registry. All slides were reviewed by a single pathologist. Tumors were classified by two sets of standard criteria.|The retrieval rate for cases was over 90{\%}. Of 342 cases reviewed, 15 were excluded for technical reasons or because malignancy was not definitively diagnosed. According to WHO/ISUP criteria, 25.7{\%} of tumors were papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMP), 34.3{\%} low-grade papillary carcinomas, 22.6{\%} high-grade papillary carcinomas, 10.1{\%} non-papillary urothelial carcinomas and 5.5{\%} carcinoma in situ. By WHO (1973) criteria, 52.5{\%} of tumors were grade 1, 21.4{\%} grade 2 and 26.1{\%} grade 3. Two-thirds of all tumors were stage Ta, 20.8{\%} stage T1 and 7.6{\%} stage {\textgreater}or=T2. 100{\%} of PUNLMPs were non-invasive, 6.3{\%} of low-grade carcinomas were invasive and 64.9{\%} of high-grade carcinomas were invasive.|Compared to clinic or hospital referral-based series, this study documents a higher percentage of non-invasive tumors and a lower percentage of muscle-invasive tumors. There was also a higher percentage of PUNLMP tumors and fewer high-grade papillary carcinomas than in other series. These results may more accurately reflect prevalence data for bladder cancer grade and stage, although geographic variability may exist.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As), a ubiquitous environmental toxicant, has recently been linked to disrupted immune function and enhanced infection susceptibility in highly exposed populations. In drinking water, as levels above the EPA maximum contaminant level occur in our US study area and are a particular health concern for pregnant women and infants. As a part of the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, we investigated whether in utero exposure to As affects risk of infant infections. We prospectively obtained information on 4-month-old infants (n=214) using a parental telephone survey on infant infections and symptoms, including respiratory infections, diarrhea and specific illnesses, as well as the duration and severity of infections. Using logistic regression and Poisson models, we evaluated the association between maternal urinary As during pregnancy and infection risks adjusted for potentially confounding factors. Maternal urinary As concentrations were related to total number of infections requiring a physician visit (relative risk (RR) per one-fold increase in As in urine=1.5; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.0, 2.1) or prescription medication (RR=1.6; 95{\%} CI=1.1, 2.4), as well as lower respiratory infections treated with prescription medication (RR=3.3; 95{\%} CI=1.2, 9.0). Associations were observed with respiratory symptoms (RR=4.0; 95{\%} CI=1.0, 15.8), upper respiratory infections (RR=1.6; 95{\%} CI=1.0, 2.5), and colds treated with prescription medication (RR=2.3; 95{\%} CI=1.0, 5.2). Our results provide initial evidence that in utero As exposure may be related to infant infection and infection severity and provide insight into the early life impacts of fetal As exposure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The dietary intake of total arsenic (tAs), inorganic arsenic (iAs) and total mercury (tHg) in lunch and breakfast servings provided by the Chilean School Meal Program (SMP) was estimated, using the duplicate-portion variant of the total diet study. Lunch and breakfast samples were collected from 65 schools throughout the country in 2006. The population sample was a group of girls and boys between 6 and 18 years old. The tAs concentration was measured via hydride-generation atomic absorption spectrometry. The total mercury concentration was measured via cold-vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. The estimated iAs intake was 12.5{\%} (5.4 mug/day) of the Provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) as proposed by the FAO/WHO, and the tHg intake was 13.2{\%} (1.9 mug/day) of the PTDI as proposed by the FAO/WHO. It was therefore concluded that tAs, iAs and tHg intake from food provided by the SMP do not pose risks to student health.},

@article{Lebeaux2020,
	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous. Previous studies have found associations between PFAS and thyroid hormones in maternal and cord sera, but the results are inconsistent. To further address this research question, we used mixture modeling to assess the associations with individual PFAS, interactions among PFAS chemicals, and the overall mixture. Methods: We collected data through the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a prospective cohort study that between 2003 and 2006 enrolled 468 pregnant women and their children in the greater Cincinnati, Ohio region. We assessed the associations of maternal serum PFAS concentrations measured during pregnancy with maternal (n = 185) and cord (n = 256) sera thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) using two mixture modeling approaches (Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and quantile g-computation) and multivariable linear regression. Additional models considered thyroid autoantibodies, other non-PFAS chemicals, and iodine deficiency as potential confounders or effect measure modifiers. Results: PFAS, considered individually or as mixtures, were generally not associated with any thyroid hormones. A doubling of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) had a positive association with cord serum TSH in BKMR models but the 95{\%} Credible Interval included the null ($\beta$ = 0.09; 95{\%} CrI: −0.08, 0.27). Using BKMR and multivariable models, we found that among children born to mothers with higher thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), PFOS, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) were associated with decreased cord FT4 suggesting modification by maternal TPOAb status. Conclusions: These findings suggest that maternal serum PFAS concentrations measured in the second trimester of pregnancy are not strongly associated with thyroid hormones in maternal and cord sera. Further analyses using robust mixture models in other cohorts are required to corroborate these findings.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of 23 elements in lung, liver and kidney from deceased smelter workers are compared with those from rural and urban controls. The analyses were made by neutron activation analysis and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Significantly higher levels of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lanthanum, lead and selenium were found in the smelter workers lungs (n = 85) compared with the rural controls (n = 15). Significantly higher concentrations of antimony, arsenic and lead were observed among all smelter workers compared with urban controls (n = 10). The highest increase, about 11-fold, was found for antimony in smelter workers compared with non-exposed controls. A six-fold increase was noted for arsenic. Workers who died from lung cancer (n = 7) had the lowest lung selenium content relative to concentrations of other metals, both compared with other disease categories among the workers (GI-cancer, other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, other causes) and with the two control groups. The low lung selenium concentrations may have influenced the development of lung cancer. The highest lung tissue levels of cadmium were found in the lung cancer group. Smokers and ex-smokers were over-represented in this group and tobacco is a known cadmium source. The highest, or one of the highest, lung values for some of the other metals (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, lanthanum and lead) were observed in one or several of the lung cancer cases. Metal concentrations in liver (metabolism) and kidney (excretion) reflect the systemic distribution. The highest cadmium levels in the liver and the lowest selenium content in the kidney were found among the lung cancer cases. A multifactorial genesis for the development of lung cancer is concluded from this study, which visualizes the need for systematic health surveillance and follow-ups both in active and retired workers. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

	abstract = {Sixty five urine samples obtained during one or two non-consecutive days from 10 healthy individuals were analysed for major (Na, Mg, K, Ca) and trace (Co, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Mo and Pb) element concentrations. Following microwave digestion, the analyses were carried out using ICP-QMS (inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry) incorporating a collision/reaction cell. Repeat analyses of quality control samples show that the procedure produces unbiased results and is well suited for routine urinalysis of the investigated elements. Concentrations were normalised using specific gravity (SG) and the resultant decrease in variability supports previous conclusions that SG-normalisation appropriately corrects for differences in urine dilution. The elemental concentrations of the individual urine samples show large differences in dispersion. Most variable are As, Co and Zn, with CVs (coefficients of variation) of {\textgreater}75{\%}. The major elements as well as Rb, Sr and Mo display intermediate variability, whilst Cu and Pb have the least elemental dispersion with CV values of about 30{\%}. A detailed assessment shows that the overall elemental variability is governed both by differences between individuals and variations for a single individual over time. Spot urine samples exhibit elemental concentrations that, on average, resemble the daily mean values to within about 30{\%} for all elements except K and Rb. Diet-related changes in urinary element concentration are most prominent for Mg, K, Co, Rb and Pb. The concentrations of Co, As and Rb appear to vary systematically with gender but this may primarily reflect co-variance with specific diets.},

Our recent studies showed increased toxicity by exposure to barium alone (≤700 µg/L) and coexposure to barium (137 µg/L) and arsenic (225 µg/L). The present edition of WHO health-based guidelines for drinking water revised in 2011 has maintained the values of arsenic (10 µg/L) and barium (700 µg/L), but not elements such as manganese, iron and zinc. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies on barium in drinking water and human samples. This study showed significant correlations between levels of arsenic and barium, but not its homologous elements (magnesium, calcium and strontium), in urine, toenail and hair samples obtained from residents of Jessore, Bangladesh. Significant correlation between levels of arsenic and barium in well drinking water and levels in human urine, toenail and hair samples were also observed. Based on these results, a high-performance and low-cost adsorbent composed of a hydrotalcite-like compound for barium and arsenic was developed. The adsorbent reduced levels of barium and arsenic from well water in Bangladesh and Vietnam to {\textless}7 µg/L within 1 min. Thus, we have showed levels of arsenic and barium in humans and propose a novel remediation system.},

	abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa) is the staple food for over half the world's population yet may represent a significant dietary source of inorganic arsenic (As), a nonthreshold, class 1 human carcinogen. Rice grain As is dominated by the inorganic species, and the organic species dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). To investigate how As species are unloaded into grain rice, panicles were excised during grain filling and hydroponically pulsed with arsenite, arsenate, glutathione-complexed As, or DMA. Total As concentrations in flag leaf, grain, and husk, were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy and As speciation in the fresh grain was determined by x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy. The roles of phloem and xylem transport were investigated by applying a +/- stem-girdling treatment to a second set of panicles, limiting phloem transport to the grain in panicles pulsed with arsenite or DMA. The results demonstrate that DMA is translocated to the rice grain with over an order magnitude greater efficiency than inorganic species and is more mobile than arsenite in both the phloem and the xylem. Phloem transport accounted for 90{\%} of arsenite, and 55{\%} of DMA, transport to the grain. Synchrotron x-ray fluorescence mapping and fluorescence microtomography revealed marked differences in the pattern of As unloading into the grain between DMA and arsenite-challenged grain. Arsenite was retained in the ovular vascular trace and DMA dispersed throughout the external grain parts and into the endosperm. This study also demonstrates that DMA speciation is altered in planta, potentially through complexation with thiols.},

	abstract = {Chronic arsenic toxicity (arsenicosis) as a result of drinking arsenic-contaminated groundwater is a major environmental health hazard throughout the world, including India. A lot of research on health effects, including genotoxic effect of chronic arsenic toxicity in humans, have been carried out in West Bengal during the last 2 decades. A review of literature including information available from West Bengal has been made to characterize the problem. Scientific journals, monographs, and proceedings of conferences with regard to human health effects, including genotoxicity, of chronic arsenic toxicity have been reviewed. Pigmentation and keratosis are the specific skin diseases characteristic of chronic arsenic toxicity. However, in West Bengal, it was found to produce various systemic manifestations, such as chronic lung disease, characterized by chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive and/or restrictive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis; liver diseases, such as non cirrhotic portal fibrosis; polyneuropathy; peripheral vascular disease; hypertension; nonpitting edema of feet/hands; conjunctival congestion; weakness; and anemia. High concentrations of arsenic, greater than or equal to 200 $\mu$g/L, during pregnancy were found to be associated with a sixfold increased risk for stillbirth. Cancers of skin, lung, and urinary bladder are the important cancers associated with this toxicity. Of the various genotoxic effects of arsenic in humans, chromosomal aberration and increased frequency of micronuclei in different cell types have been found to be significant. Various probable mechanisms have been incriminated to cause DNA damage because of chronic arsenic toxicity. The results of the study in West Bengal suggest that deficiency in DNA repair capacity, perturbation of methylation of promoter region of p53 and p16 genes, and genomic methylation alteration may be involved in arsenic-induced disease manifestation in humans. P53 polymorphism has been found to be associated with increased occurrence of arsenic-induced keratosis. Of the various genes involved in the regulation of arsenic metabolism, single-nucleotide polymorphisms of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, in one study, showed increased occurrence of arsenicosis.

	abstract = {In this work we compare the inorganic content of bottled mineral water, steadily increasing as a source of drinking water, and tap water which is often affected by intensive chemical treatment Bottled mineral water should be representative of the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, whereas tap water could derive from multiple sources such as groundwater or surface water including rivers and reservoirs. The data of this paper were collected within a project carried out by the EuroGeoSurvey Geochemistry Expert Group aimed at the characterization of groundwater geochemistry using bottled mineral waters purchased in supermarkets all over Europe which included also the analysis, for comparative purposes, of tap water. The comparison of two extensive databases of 69 elements on 157 tap water samples and 178 bottled mineral waters on Italian territory enabled the recognition of very wide ranges of variation in both databases. The elements with the highest variation are Y, Li, U, I, HCO 3 -, Be, Yb, Tm, Zr, Lu, F, and Cs in the bottled mineral database and Ga, PO 4 3-, Zn, Mg, Ti, Th, Cd, Pb, and Cu in the tap water database. The first group of elements in bottled mineral water includes elements with localized very high concentration due to prolonged interaction with unusual rock types, whereas the second group of elements in tap water includes elements that are released by corrosion reaction with the material of the distributing systems. Aside from these differences, tap water displayed a much more restricted range of variation for major ions compared to bottled mineral water because of quality guidelines imposed by Italian Law for selected major ions (Ca, Cl -, SO 4 2-).Some elements do not display statistically different distributions between the two databases (As, Cr, I, Li, Mo, Rb, Sr, Se, U, V) and for some of these (e.g., Cr and V) non-natural sources cannot be excluded in both databases (e.g. pipeline corrosion or container leaching). The spatial distribution of the ionic species provides similar information as far as the role of geology, groundwater condition and, additional sources is concerned. Among the elements displaying significant differences, Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn are strongly enriched in tap water samples, whereas Be, Cs, Sb, Sn and Tl are significantly enriched in the bottled mineral water. The group of elements enriched in tap water is controlled also by corrosion processes, so their spatial distribution is random and virtually unrelated to geological or geochemical conditions. Among the elements enriched in the bottled mineral water group, Sb derives from PET container leaching, whereas the other elements likely derive from water-rock interaction. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Exposure to arsenic has been associated with increased risk of reduced lung function in adults, but the adverse impacts in early life are unclear. We aim to examine whether prenatal and childhood arsenic exposure is associated with reduced lung function and increased airway inflammation in school-aged children. Children born in the MINIMat cohort in rural Bangladesh were evaluated at 9years of age (n=540). Arsenic exposure was assessed in urine (U-As) that was collected from mothers during early pregnancy and their children aged 4.5 and 9years. In the 9-year-old children, lung function was assessed using spirometry and airway inflammation was assessed by the NIOX MINO system. C-reactive protein (CRP) and Clara cell secretory protein (CC16) concentrations were measured in plasma by immunoassays. The U-As concentrations in 9-year-old children were lower (median 53$\mu$g/l) compared to their mothers (median 76$\mu$g/l). Maternal U-As (log2 transformed) was inversely associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at 1s (FEV1) ($\beta$=-12; 95{\%} CI: -22, -1.5; p=0.031 and $\beta$=-12; 95{\%} CI: -22, -1.9; p=0.023, respectively) in all children, and the associations were stronger in boys and among children with adequate height and weight, as well as among those whose mothers had higher percentages of methylarsonic acid (MMA) and lower percentages of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). U-As (log2 transformed) at 4.5 and 9years was positively associated with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) concentrations in boys ($\beta$=0.89; 95{\%} CI: 0.13, 1.66; p=0.022 and $\beta$=0.88; 95{\%} CI: 0.16, 1.61; p=0.017, respectively) but not in girls. Increased CC16 concentrations were associated with higher lung function indices. In conclusion, our findings suggest that prenatal arsenic exposure is related to impaired lung function, while childhood exposure may increase airway inflammation, particularly in boys.},

	abstract = {Many aquifers in various parts of the world have been found to be contaminated with arsenic at concentration above 0.05 mg/L. However reports of large number of affected people in India and Bangladesh are unprecedented. Characteristic skin lesions (pigmentation, depigmentation and keratosis) are the hallmark signs of chronic arsenic toxicity. Emerging evidences show that ingestion of arsenic through drinking water may also lead to non-malignant respiratory effects. Early report of non-malignant pulmonary effect of chronic ingestion of arsenic was available from studies in children in Chile as early as 1970. However on the basis of case studies, respiratory effect of chronic arsenic toxicity in adults following dinking of arsenic contaminated water in West Bengal was first reported in 1997. Epidemiological studies carried out in West Bengal on a population of 7683 showed that the prevalence odds ratio (POR) estimates were markedly increased for participants with arsenic induced skin lesions who also had high levels of arsenic in their current drinking water source (≥0.5 mg/L) compared with individuals who had normal skin and were exposed to low levels of arsenic ({\textless}0.05 mg/L). In participants with skin lesions, age-adjusted POR estimates for chronic cough were 7.8 for females (95{\%} CI:3.1-19.5) and 5.0 for males (95{\%} CI:2.6-9.9). In Bangladesh, similar study carried out on a population of 218 showed that the crude prevalence ratio for chronic bronchitis was found to be 10.3 (95{\%} CI:2.4-43.1) for females and 1.6 (95{\%} CI:0.8-3.1) for males. Reports of lung function tests were available from both hospital and population based studies. Results show evidences of restrictive, obstructive and combined obstructive and restrictive lung disease in different people having chronic lung disease associated with chronic arsenic toxicity. On the basis of clinical study, chest X-ray and HRCT done in Arsenicosis patients with features of chronic lung disease, the abnormalities observed were varied. Evidences of obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD) and bronchiectasis were found in some of the cases. Results of studies carried out on people showing features of Arsenicosis due to drinking arsenic contaminated water provide evidence that arsenic is a potent respiratory toxicant, even following ingestion.

An analytical method for the determination of iAs, methylarsonic acid (MA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in cereal-based food and infant cereals is reported. The method was optimised and validated to achieve low LODs. Ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICPMS) was used for arsenic speciation. The main quality parameters were established. To expand the applicability of the method, different cereal products were analysed: bread, biscuits, breakfast cereals, wheat flour, corn snacks, pasta and infant cereals. The total and inorganic arsenic content of 29 cereal-based food samples ranged between 3.7-35.6 and 3.1-26.0 $\mu$g As kg(-1), respectively. The present method could be considered a valuable tool for assessing inorganic arsenic contents in cereal-based foods.},

Results were separated on the base of the fishing site and the concentrations were reworked to assess the average daily intake to In-As as well as Target Hazard Quotient and Cancer Risk. Overall, the greater availability in Tot-As concentration in the pelagic compartment found in the Mediterranean Sea is not present along the European coasts of Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, only in the Mediterranean Sea, results highlighted significant differences between Tot-As concentrations in seafood subgroups. In both areas, In-As concentrations showed the following trend: molluscs {\textgreater} pelagic {\textgreater} demersal with significant differences between subgroups. The European populations more exposed to In-As from fish and molluscs are the French, Spanish, Italian and Greek, with particular regards to children of 3--6 years old, which should minimize the consumption of molluscs to avoid carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), abundant in minimally processed plant-based foods, rich in monounsaturated fat from olive oil, but lower in saturated fat, meats, and dairy products, seems an ideal nutritional model for cardiovascular health. Methodological aspects of Mediterranean intervention trials, limitations in the quality of some meta-analyses, and other issues may have raised recent controversies. It remains unclear whether such limitations are important enough as to attenuate the postulated cardiovascular benefits of the MedDiet. We aimed to critically review current evidence on the role of the MedDiet in cardiovascular health. We systematically searched observational prospective cohorts and randomized controlled trials which explicitly reported to assess the effect of the MedDiet on hard cardiovascular end points. We critically assessed all the original cohorts and randomized controlled trials included in the 5 most comprehensive meta-analyses published between 2014 and 2018 and additional prospective studies not included in these meta-analyses, totaling 45 reports of prospective studies (including 4 randomized controlled trials and 32 independent observational cohorts). We addressed the existing controversies on methodology and other issues. Some departures from individual randomization in a subsample of the landmark Spanish trial (PREDIMED [Prevenci{\'{o}}n con Dieta Mediterr{\'{a}}nea]) did not represent any clinically meaningful attenuation in the strength of its findings and the results of PREDIMED were robust in a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The criteria for causality were met and potential sources of controversies did not represent any reason to compromise the main findings of the available observational studies and randomized controlled trials. The available evidence is large, strong, and consistent. Better conformity with the traditional MedDiet is associated with better cardiovascular health outcomes, including clinically meaningful reductions in rates of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and total cardiovascular disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very little evidence exists concerning the possible impairment of children's intellectual function in relation to arsenic exposure in utero and during childhood.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 351 children age 5 to 15 years who were selected from a source population of 7683 people in West Bengal, India, in 2001-2003. Intellectual function was assessed with 6 subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children as well as with the Total Sentence Recall test, the Colored Progressive Matrices test, and a pegboard test. Arsenic in urine and lifetime water sources (including during the pregnancy period) were assessed using measurements of samples from 409 wells. The test scores were analyzed with linear regression analyses based on the method of generalized estimating equations incorporating relevant covariates.

RESULTS: Stratifying urinary arsenic concentrations into tertiles, we found associations between arsenic and reductions in the adjusted scores of the vocabulary test (0, -0.14, -0.28; P for trend = 0.02), the object assembly test (0, -0.16, -0.24; P for trend = 0.03), and the picture completion test (0, -0.15, -0.26; P for trend = 0.02). These findings correspond to relative declines of 12{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval =0.4{\%} to 24{\%}) in the vocabulary test, 21{\%} (-0.8{\%} to 42{\%}) in the object assembly test, and of 13{\%} (0.3{\%} to 24{\%}) in the picture completion test in the upper urinary arsenic tertile. However, we did not find evidence of an association between test results and arsenic water concentrations during pregnancy or childhood.

CONCLUSIONS: Current arsenic concentrations in urine, which reflect all sources of recent exposure, including water and food, were associated with small decrements in intellectual testing in school-aged children in West Bengal. We did not see associations between long-term water arsenic concentrations and intellectual function.},

@article{Williams2007a,
	abstract = {Paired grain, shoot, and soil of 173 individual sample sets of commercially farmed temperate rice, wheat, and barley were surveyed to investigate variation in the assimilation and translocation of arsenic (As). Rice samples were obtained from the Carmargue (France), Do{\~{n}}ana (Spain), Cadiz (Spain), California, and Arkansas. Wheat and barleywere collected from Cornwall and Devon (England) and the east coast of Scotland. Transfer of As from soil to grain was an order of magnitude greater in rice than for wheat and barley, despite lower rates of shoot-to-grain transfer. Rice grain As levels over 0.60 microg g(-1) d. wt were found in rice grown in paddy soil of around only 10 microg g(-1) As, showing that As in paddy soils is problematic with respect to grain As levels. This is due to the high shoot/soil ratio of approximately 0.8 for rice compared to 0.2 and 0.1 for barley and wheat, respectively. The differences in these transfer ratios are probably due to differences in As speciation and dynamics in anaerobic rice soils compared to aerobic soils for barley and wheat. In rice, the export of As from the shoot to the grain appears to be under tight physiological control as the grain/shoot ratio decreases by more than an order of magnitude (from approximately 0.3 to 0.003 mg/kg) and as As levels in the shoots increase from 1 to 20 mg/kg. A down regulation of shoot-to-grain export may occur in wheat and barley, but it was not detected at the shoot As levels found in this survey. Some agricultural soils in southwestern England had levels in excess of 200 microg g(-1) d. wt, although the grain levels for wheat and barley never breached 0.55 microg g(-1) d. wt. These grain levels were achieved in rice in soils with an order of magnitude lower As. Thus the risk posed by As in the human food-chain needs to be considered in the context of anaerobic verses aerobic ecosystems.},

@article{Tsuji2019,
	abstract = {The biologic effects of inorganic arsenic predominantly involve reaction of the trivalent forms with sulfhydryl groups in critical proteins in target cells, potentially leading to various toxicologic events including cancer. This mode of action is a threshold process, requiring sufficient concentrations of trivalent arsenic to disrupt normal cellular function. Nevertheless, cancer risk assessments for inorganic arsenic have traditionally utilized various dose-response models that extrapolate risks from high doses assuming low-dose linearity without a threshold. We present here an approach for a cancer risk assessment for inorganic arsenic in drinking water that involves considerations of this threshold process. Extensive investigations in mode of action analysis, in vitro studies ({\textgreater}0.1 µM), and in animal studies ({\textgreater}2 mg/L in drinking water or 2 mg/kg of diet), collectively indicate a threshold basis for inorganic arsenic-related cancers. These studies support a threshold for the effects of arsenic in humans of 50--100 µg/L in drinking water (about 65 µg/L). We then evaluate the epidemiology of cancers of the urinary bladder, lung, and skin and non-cancer skin changes for consistency with this calculated value, focusing on studies involving low-level exposures to inorganic arsenic primarily in drinking water (approximately {\textless}150 µg/L). Based on the relevant epidemiological studies with individual-level data, a threshold level for inorganic arsenic in the drinking water for these cancers is estimated to be around 100 µg/L, with strong evidence that it is between 50 and 150 µg/L, consistent with the value calculated based on mechanistic, in vitro and in vivo investigations. This evaluation provides an alternative mode of action-based approach for assessing health-protective levels for oral arsenic exposure based on the collective in vitro, in vivo, and human evidence rather than the use of a linear low-dose extrapolation based on default assumptions and theories.},

@article{Wasserman2018,
	abstract = {Background: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (As) from drinking water is associated with modest deficits in intellectual function in young children; it is unclear whether deficits occur during adolescence, when key brain functions are more fully developed. Objectives: We sought to determine the degree to which As exposure is associated with adolescent intelligence, and the contributory roles of lead, cadmium, manganese and selenium. Methods: We recruited a cross-section of 726 14--16 year olds (mean age = 14.8 years) whose mothers are participants in the Bangladesh Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), and whose household well water As levels, which varied widely, were well characterized. Using a culturally modified version of the WISC-IV, we examined raw Full Scale scores, and Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Processing Speed Indices. Blood levels of As (BAs), Mn, Pb, Cd and Se were assessed at the time of the visit, as was creatinine-adjusted urinary As (UAs/Cr). Results: Linear regression analyses revealed that BAs was significantly negatively associated with all WISC-IV scores except for Perceptual Reasoning. With UAs/Cr as the exposure variable, we observed significantly negative associations for all WISC-IV scores. Except for Se, blood levels of other metals, were also associated with lower WISC-IV scores. Controlling for covariates, doubling BAs, or UAs/Cr, was associated with a mean decrement (95{\%} CI) of 3.3 (1.1, 5.5), or 3.0 (1.2, 4.5) points, respectively, in raw Full scale scores with a sample mean of 177.6 (SD = 36.8). Confirmatory analyses using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, which identifies important mixture members, supported these findings; the primary contributor of the mixture was BAs, followed by BCd. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the adverse consequences of As exposure on neurodevelopment observed in other cross-sectional studies of younger children are also apparent during adolescence. They also implicate Cd as a neurotoxic element that deserves more attention.},

We conducted a follow-up study to ascertain if toenail arsenic concentrations, and risk factors for exposure, had changed over a five year period in an historical gold mining region in western regional Victoria, Australia. Residential soil samples (N= 14) and toenail clippings (N= 24) were analyzed for total arsenic using instrumental neutron activation analysis, including 19 toenail clippings samples that were obtained from the same study cohort in 2006. Toenail arsenic concentrations in 2011 (geometric mean, 0.171. $\mu$g/g; range, 0.030-0.540. $\mu$g/g) were significantly lower than those in 2006 (geometric mean, 0.464. $\mu$g/g; range, 0.150-2.10. $\mu$g/g; p{\textless}. 0.001).

	abstract = {Rice consumption is a major source of cadmium and arsenic for the population of Asia. We investigated the effects of water management in rice paddy on levels of cadmium and arsenic in Japanese rice grains. Flooding increased arsenic concentrations in rice grains, whereas aerobic treatment increased the concentration of cadmium. Flooding for 3 weeks before and after heading was most effective in reducing grain cadmium concentrations, but this treatment increased the arsenic concentration considerably, whereas aerobic treatment during the same period was effective in reducing arsenic concentrations but increased the cadmium concentration markedly. Flooding treatment after heading was found to be more effective than flooding treatment before heading in reducing rice grain cadmium without a concomitant increase in total arsenic levels, although it increased inorganic arsenic levels. Concentrations of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in grain were very low under aerobic conditions but increased under flooded conditions. DMA accounted for 3-52{\%} of the total arsenic concentration in grain grown in soil with a lower arsenic concentration and 10-80{\%} in soil with a higher arsenic concentration. A possible explanation for the accumulation of DMA in rice grains is that DMA translocates from shoots/roots to the grains more readily than does inorganic arsenic.},

	abstract = {Metallomics, a discipline integrating sciences that address the biometals and biometalloids, provides new opportunities for discoveries. As part of a systems biology approach, it draws attention to the importance of many chemical elements in biochemistry. Traditionally, biochemistry has treated life as organic chemistry, separating it from inorganic chemistry, considered a field reserved for investigating the inanimate world. However, inorganic chemistry is part of the chemistry of life, and metallomics contributes by showing the importance of a neglected fifth branch of building blocks in biochemistry. Metallomics adds chemical elements/metals to the four building blocks of biomolecules and the fields of their studies: carbohydrates (glycome), lipids (lipidome), proteins (proteome), and nucleotides (genome). The realization that non-essential elements are present in organisms in addition to essential elements represents a certain paradigm shift in our thinking, as it stipulates inquiries into the functional implications of virtually all the natural elements. This article discusses opportunities arising from metallomics for a better understanding of human biology and health. It looks at a biological periodic system of the elements as a sum of metallomes and focuses on the major roles of metals in about 30--40{\%} of all proteins, the metalloproteomes. It emphasizes the importance of zinc and iron biology and discusses why it is important to investigate non-essential metal ions, what bioinformatics approaches can contribute to understanding metalloproteins, and why metallomics has a bright future in the many dimensions it covers.},

	abstract = {Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (S-XRF) was utilized to locate arsenic (As) in polished (white) and unpolished (brown) rice grains from the United States, China, and Bangladesh. In white rice As was generally dispersed throughout the grain, the bulk of which constitutes the endosperm. In brown rice As was found to be preferentially localized at the surface, in the region corresponding to the pericarp and aleurone layer. Copper, iron, manganese, and zinc localization followed that of arsenic in brown rice, while the location for cadmium and nickel was distinctly different, showing relatively even distribution throughout the endosperm. The localization of As in the outer grain of brown rice was confirmed by laser ablation ICP-MS. Arsenic speciation of all grains using spatially resolved X-ray absorption near edge structure (micro-XANES) and bulk extraction followed by anion exchange HPLC-ICP-MS revealed the presence of mainly inorganic As and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). However, the two techniques indicated different proportions of inorganic:organic As species. A wider survey of whole grain speciation of white (n=39) and brown (n=45) rice samples from numerous sources (field collected, supermarket survey, and pot trials) showed that brown rice had a higher proportion of inorganic arsenic present than white rice. Furthermore, the percentage of DMA present in the grain increased along with total grain arsenic.},

	abstract = {Arsenic concentrations from 20 450 domestic wells in the U.S. were used to develop a logistic regression model of the probability of having arsenic {\textgreater}10 $\mu$g/L (" high arsenic "), which is presented at the county, state, and national scales. Variables representing geologic sources, geochemical, hydrologic, and physical features were among the significant predictors of high arsenic. For U.S. Census blocks, the mean probability of arsenic {\textgreater}10 $\mu$g/L was multiplied by the population using domestic wells to estimate the potential high-arsenic domestic-well population. Approximately 44.1 M people in the U.S. use water from domestic wells. The population in the conterminous U.S. using water from domestic wells with predicted arsenic concentration {\textgreater}10 $\mu$g/L is 2.1 M people (95{\%} CI is 1.5 to 2.9 M). Although areas of the U.S. were underrepresented with arsenic data, predictive variables available in national data sets were used to estimate high arsenic in unsampled areas. Additionally, by predicting to all of the conterminous U.S., we identify areas of high and low potential exposure in areas of limited arsenic data. These areas may be viewed as potential areas to investigate further or to compare to more detailed local information. Linking predictive modeling to private well use information nationally, despite the uncertainty, is beneficial for broad screening of the population at risk from elevated arsenic in drinking water from private wells. ■ INTRODUCTION Domestic wells (private or homeowner wells) are the dominant source of drinking water for people living in rural parts of the United States. 1 Geogenic arsenic affects many domestic wells in the U.S. 2,3 and is thus a national public health concern. 4−6 Recent work in the U.S. indicates that low-level arsenic may impact fetal growth 7 and may be related to preterm birth. 8 In the U.S., domestic well water quality is generally not regulated. This means that it is largely up to the well owner to understand the arsenic hazard and take steps to mitigate any exposure risk. To understand the risk and to make progress on reducing exposure in a systematic way, we need better estimates of the population affected by high arsenic concentrations. About 44.1 M people in the conterminous U.S.14{\%} of the total populationrely on domestic wells for household water use. 5 The U.S. domestic well population tends to mimic the general population distribution throughout the country, serving people not connected to public supply distribution systems and people in rural areas. 5 Because high concentrations of arsenic in water are not evident by taste or smell, the only way to know how much arsenic is in drinking water is to have it tested, a precaution utilized infrequently by domestic well owners.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved. A hydroponic experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of phosphorus (P) nutrition on arsenic (As) uptake and translocation within the seedlings of rice cultivars. The experiment occurred in three stages: I 5 days of acclimatization (nutritive solution); II 10 days under P (0.0 and 0.09 mM) and As (0.0 and 100 $\mu$M) treatments; III 5 days under recovery. The As exposure had significant effect reducing dry weights of shoots or roots, resulted in elevated concentrations of As in shoot tissues. BR-IRGA 409 showed the highest susceptibility to As in biomass production and root system parameters regardless the P level. This cultivar showed contrasting responses of As translocation to shoot tissue dependent on P levels, with the highest As concentration under low P and lowest under normal P levels. P nutrition was most striking on plants recovery for all cultivars under As exposure. Clearer separation of cultivars for phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) occurred at lower shoot P contents, that was, at higher levels of P deficiency stress. IRGA 424 showed higher PUE as compared to the others cultivars. Our results go some way to understanding the role of P nutrition in controlling the effects of As in rice shoots.},

	abstract = {The disturbance and oxidation of sulfidic soils can cause an increase in acidity resulting in the mobilization of high concentrations of metals in groundwater or connected surface water. This is an increasing problem in urban areas of Australia and internationally. We hypothesized that the risks of exposure to contaminated water would be increased by this phenomenon. We undertook a preliminary investigation of human exposure to metals recruiting 27 residents in an acid sulfate soil-affected area, 21 residents using a bore (groundwater) for home-grown produce irrigation, and 6 residents who did not. Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a sample of urine (first morning void), toenails (from all 10 toes), hair, and borewater. Only hair metal concentrations were higher in those using bore water and ranged from below detection ({\textless}DL) to 38 mg/kg Al; {\textless}DL = 0.07 mg/kg As, 0.02-0.57 mg/kg Cd, 0.19-4.3 mg/kg Pb, 11-160 mg/kg Cu, and 99-280 mg/kg Zn. The data indicate exposure to metals in bore-water users might be occurring and further investigation is warranted even though the concentrations recorded in this study are considered low.},

	abstract = {Background: Recall bias may provide discrepant relationships of pet exposure with sensitization and asthma development. We studied prospectively effects of pets at home on development of sensitization, asthma and respiratory symptoms from birth up to age 8 years. Methods: Event history analysis was performed on annually registered data of 2951 children, participating in the PIAMA birth cohort study. Results: Children with a cat or dog at home at 3 months of age had a significantly lower prevalence of sensitization to inhalant allergens at age 8, but not of asthma. A cat decreased the risk of house dust mite sensitization at age 8 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.95], a dog of pollen sensitization (OR = 0.49, 95{\%} CI: 0.29-0.83). A cat or dog at home did not significantly affect asthma incidence in each subsequent year. From 2 years of age onwards, the incidence of wheeze (OR = 1.52, 95{\%} CI: 1.12-2.05) and a dry cough at night (OR = 1.28, 95{\%} CI: 1.05-1.57) was higher in children with a dog, whereas removal of a dog increased the risk of developing asthma symptoms. Comparing analyses using prospectively and retrospectively collected data on diagnosed asthma showed important recall bias. Conclusions: Our prospective study shows a protective effect of early presence of pets at home on sensitization to inhalant allergens, but no prevention of asthma development. Furthermore, children with pets had more frequent transient or intermittent asthma symptoms. Parental report of asthma by recall may provide spurious results of these associations. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.},

	abstract = {Glycoside hydrolases (GHs), the enzymes that breakdown complex carbohydrates, are a highly diversified class of key enzymes associated with the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions. To learn more about the diversity of GHs and their potential role in a variety of gut microbiomes, we used a combination of 16S, metagenomic and targeted amplicon sequencing data to study one of these enzyme families in detail. Specifically, we employed a functional gene-targeted metagenomic approach to the 1-4-$\alpha$-glucan-branching enzyme (gBE) gene in the gut microbiomes of four host species (human, chicken, cow and pig). The characteristics of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and operational glucan-branching units (OGBUs) were distinctive in each of hosts. Human and pig were most similar in OTUs profiles while maintaining distinct OGBU profiles. Interestingly, the phylogenetic profiles identified from 16S and gBE gene sequences differed, suggesting the presence of different gBE genes in the same OTU across different vertebrate hosts. Our data suggest that gene-targeted metagenomic analysis is useful for an in-depth understanding of the diversity of a particular gene of interest. Specific carbohydrate metabolic genes appear to be carried by distinct OTUs in different individual hosts and among different vertebrate species' microbiomes, the characteristics of which differ according to host genetic background and/or diet.},

Compared to traditional microbiological methods, VitaFast({\textregistered}) kits significantly reduce sample processing time and provide greater reliability, higher productivity and better accuracy. Recently, simultaneous determination of vitamin B12, folic acid and biotin in one sample is urgently required when evaluating the quality of infant formulae in our practical work. However, the present sample preparation protocols which are developed for individual test systems, are incompatible with simultaneous determination of several analytes. To solve this problem, a novel "three-in-one" sample preparation method is herein developed for simultaneous determination of B-group water-soluble vitamins using VitaFast({\textregistered}) kits. The performance of this novel "three-in-one" sample preparation method was systematically evaluated through comparing with individual sample preparation protocols. The experimental results of the assays which employed "three-in-one" sample preparation method were in good agreement with those obtained from conventional VitaFast({\textregistered}) extraction methods, indicating that the proposed "three-in-one" sample preparation method is applicable to the present three VitaFast({\textregistered}) vitamin test systems, thus offering a promising alternative for the three independent sample preparation methods. The proposed new sample preparation method will significantly improve the efficiency of infant formulae inspection.},

	abstract = {This study characterizes intestinal absorption of arsenic species using in vitro system Caco-2/HT29-MTX cocultures in various proportions (100/0 to 30/70). The species assayed were As(V), As(III), monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)], monomethylarsonous acid [MMA(III)], dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)], and dimethylarsinous acid [DMA(III)]. The results show that the apparent permeability (P(app)) values of pentavalent species increase significantly in the Caco-2/HT29-MTX cocultures in comparison with the Caco-2 monoculture, probably because of enhancement of paracellular transport. For MMA(III) and DMA(III), P(app) decreases in the Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell model, and for As(III), there is no change in P(app) between the two culture models. Transport studies of arsenic solubilized from cooked foods (rice, garlic, and seaweed) after applying an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion showed that arsenic absorption also varies with the model used, increasing with the incorporation of HT29-MTX in the culture. These results show the importance of choosing a suitable in vitro model when evaluating intestinal arsenic absorption processes.},

	abstract = {Systematic creatinine adjustment of urinary concentrations of biomarkers has been a challenge over the past years because the assumption of a constant creatinine excretion rate appears erroneous and the issue of overadjustment has recently emerged. This study aimed at determining whether systematic creatinine adjustment is to be recommended for urinary concentrations of trace elements (TEs) in environmental settings. Paired 24-h collection and random spot urine samples (spotU) were obtained from 39 volunteers not occupationally exposed to TEs. Four models to express TEs concentration in spotU were tested to predict the 24-h excretion rate of these TEs (TE $\mu$g/24h) considered as the gold standard reference: absolute concentration (TE $\mu$g/l); ratio to creatinine (TE $\mu$g/gcr); TE $\mu$g/gcr adjusted to creatinine (TE $\mu$g/gcr-adj); and concentration adjusted to specific gravity (TE $\mu$g/l-SG). As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Li, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sn, Sb, Se, Te, V and Zn were analyzed by inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometry. There was no single pattern of relationship between urinary TEs concentrations in spotU and TE $\mu$g/24h. TE $\mu$g/l predicted TE $\mu$g/24h with an explained variance ranging from 0 to 60{\%}. Creatinine adjustment improved the explained variance by an additional 5 to ∼60{\%} for many TEs, but with a risk of overadjustment for the most of them. This issue could be addressed by adjusting TE concentrations on the basis of the regression coefficient of the relationship between TE $\mu$g/gcr and creatinine concentration. SG adjustment was as suitable as creatinine adjustment to predict TE $\mu$g/24h with no SG-overadjustment (except V). Regarding Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Te, none of the models were found to reflect TE $\mu$g/24h. In the context of environmental exposure, systematic creatinine adjustment is not recommended for urinary concentrations of TEs. SG adjustment appears to be a more reliable alternative. For some TEs, however, neither methods appear suitable.},

The Spanish legislation sets a maximum total-As content in confectionery products at 0.1 g/g. T-As concentrations were above the permitted maximum limit (mean of 0.219$\pm$0.008 g/g). All As was present in the form of toxic inorganic species. The daily consumption of licorice-confections in Spain is 1.1 g and leads to a daily intake of inorganic- As of 0.23 g (0.2{\%} of the tolerable daily intake of inorganic As for a teenager). These experimental results proved that even though high total-As concentrations were found in licorice throat pearls and that all the As found was present as inorganic species, no significant risks for health are expected just by considering this As source.},

	abstract = {At high concentrations, inorganic arsenic can cause bladder cancer in humans. However, it is unclear whether low exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water ({\textless}100 microg/liter) is related to bladder cancer risk. No study has been known to use biomarkers to assess the relation between individual arsenic exposure and bladder cancer risk. Toenail samples provide an integrated measure of internal arsenic exposure and reflect long-term exposure. The authors examined the relation between toenail arsenic levels and bladder cancer risk among participants in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, a cohort of Finnish male smokers aged 50-69 years. Data for 280 incident bladder cancer cases, identified between baseline (1985-1988) and April 1999, were available for analysis. One control was matched to each case on the basis of age, toenail collection date, intervention group, and smoking duration. Arsenic levels in toenail samples were determined by using neutron activation analysis. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios. Arsenic toenail concentrations in this Finnish study were similar to those reported in US studies (range: 0.02-17.5 microg/g). The authors observed no association between inorganic arsenic concentration and bladder cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.13, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.70, 1.81 for the highest vs. lowest quartile). These findings suggest that low-level arsenic exposure is unlikely to explain a substantial excess risk of bladder cancer.},

Few studies have evaluated whether long-term, low-level arsenic exposure is associated with neuropsychological functioning in adults. Objectives To investigate the association between long-term, low-level inorganic arsenic exposure and neuropsychological functioning among American Indians aged 64--95. Methods We assessed 928 participants in the Strong Heart Study by using data on arsenic species in urine samples collected at baseline (1989--1991) and results of standardized tests of global cognition, executive functioning, verbal learning and memory, fine motor functioning, and speed of mental processing administered during comprehensive follow-up evaluations in 2009--2013. We calculated the difference in neuropsychological functioning for a 10{\%} increase in urinary arsenic with adjustment for sex, age, education, and study site. Results The sum of inorganic and methylated arsenic species (∑As) in urine was associated with limited fine motor functioning and processing speed. A 10{\%} increase in ∑As was associated with a.10 (95{\%} CI −.20, −.01) decrease on the Finger Tapping Test for the dominant hand and a.13 decrease (95{\%} CI −.21, −.04) for the non-dominant hand. Similarly, a 10{\%} increase in ∑As was associated with a.15 (95{\%} CI −.29,.00) decrease on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Fourth Edition Coding Subtest. ∑As was not associated with other neuropsychological functions. Conclusions Findings indicate an adverse association between increased urinary arsenic fine motor functioning and processing speed, but not with other neuropsychological functioning, among elderly American Indians.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reduced lung function in early infancy has been associated with later obstructive airway diseases. We assessed whether reduced lung function shortly after birth predicts asthma 10 years later. METHODS: We conducted a prospective birth cohort study of healthy infants in which we measured lung function shortly after birth with the use of tidal breathing flow-volume loops (the fraction of expiratory time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time [tPTEF/tE]) in 802 infants and passive respiratory mechanics, including respiratory-system compliance, in 664 infants. At 10 years of age, 616 children (77{\%}) were re-assessed by measuring lung function, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (by means of a methacholine challenge) and by conducting a structured interview to determine whether there was a history of asthma or current asthma. RESULTS: As compared with children whose tPTEF/t E shortly after birth was above the median, children whose t PTEF/tE was at or below the median were more likely at 10 years of age to have a history of asthma (24.3{\%} vs. 16.2{\%}, P=0.01), to have current asthma (14.6{\%} vs. 7.5{\%}, P=0.005), and to have severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness, defined as a methacholine dose of less than 1.0 $\mu$mol causing a 20{\%} fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (9.1{\%} vs. 4.9{\%}, P=0.05). As compared with children whose respiratory-system compliance was above the median, children with respiratory compliance at or below the median more often had a history of asthma (27.4{\%} vs. 14.8{\%}; P=0.001) and current asthma (15.0{\%} vs. 7.7{\%}, P=0.009), although this measure was not associated with later measurements of lung function. At 10 years of age, t PTEF/tE at birth correlated weakly with the maximal midexpiratory flow rate (r=0.10, P=0.01) but not with FEV1 or forced vital capacity.

Of 25 374 eligible participants, 5213 were identified as rice consumers using guidelines established in previous research. Health parameters of interest included body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), blood lipids (total, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides), C-reactive protein, and others. Analyses were conducted to determine if rice consumers had lower odds ratio (ie, risk) of being overweight; being obese; having metabolic syndrome, elevated blood lipids, and elevated blood pressure; and other related parameters. Main results (P {\textless} .05) show an association between eating at least 1 daily serving of rice (white or brown) and better health and diet parameters including less total fat, saturated fat, and added sugars; higher amounts of more than 12 essential vitamins and minerals, including iron, folate, and other B vitamins; more fruit and legumes; nearly 4 tsp (16 g) less added sugar; and 7 g less solid fats.

Central to growing interest in the field is the hope that more can be learned about the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying processes of human development and disease. Researchers have begun to examine epigenetic alterations -- such as changes in promoter DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, and expression of miRNA -- to learn more about epigenetic regulation in the placenta, an organ whose proper development and function are crucial to the health growth and survival of the developing fetus. A number of studies are now making important links between alterations to appropriate epigenetic regulation in the placenta and diseases of gestation and early life. In addition, these studies are adding important insight into our understanding of trophoblast biology and differentiation as well as placental immunology. Examining epigenetic alterations in the placenta will prove especially important in the search for biomarkers of exposure, pathology, and disease risk and can provide critical insights into the biology of development and pathogenesis of disease. Thus, epigenetic alterations may aid in disease diagnosis and prognosis as well as in targeting new treatment and prevention strategies},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic agronomic practices could negatively affect the agricultural soil which is the main source for inorganic arsenic (i-As) contamination in rice fields due to flooding. The presence of essential elements could be impacted by food industry units operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of husking and polishing on mineral essential elements and inorganic As species in rice from Protected Natural Reserve ``Marjal de Pego-Oliva''. The amount of all studied elements was significantly affected by husking (a decrease of Ca, Na and Pb, 360 to 101 mg kg−1, 202 to 46.9 mg kg-1 and 17.9 to 5.70 $\mu$g kg−1, respectively) and by polishing (a reduction of Na, Mg, P, K, Ca and Cu, 46.9--26.8 mg kg−1, 1600 to 481 mg kg−1, 4050 to 1530 mg kg−1, 2780 to 882 mg kg−1, 101 to 53.7 mg kg−1, and 3600 to 2840, $\mu$g kg−1, respectively).The replacement of white rice (WR) to brown rice (BR) could enhance the daily dietary intake of essential elements to reach the dietary reference values and the maximum i-As (40.9 and 44.9 i-As $\mu$g kg-1 for BR and WR, respectively) was below the maximum level recently established by European Food Safety Agency.},

	abstract = {Silicon is beneficial to plant growth and helps plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses by preventing lodging (falling over) and increasing resistance to pests and diseases, as well as other stresses. Silicon is essential for high and sustainable production of rice, but the molecular mechanism responsible for the uptake of silicon is unknown. Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant. This gene belongs to the aquaporin family and is constitutively expressed in the roots. Lsi1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells, where casparian strips are located. Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake. Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only. The identification of a silicon transporter provides both an insight into the silicon uptake system in plants, and a new strategy for producing crops with high resistance to multiple stresses by genetic modification of the root's silicon uptake capacity.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic alterations related to prenatal neurotoxic metals exposure may be key in understanding the origins of cognitive and neurobehavioral problems in children. Placental glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) methylation has been linked to neurobehavioral risk in early life, but has not been examined in response to neurotoxic metals exposure despite parallel lines of research showing metals exposure and NR3C1 methylation each contribute to a similar set of neurobehavioral phenotypes. Thus, we conducted a study of prenatal neurotoxic metals exposure and placental NR3C1 methylation in a cohort of healthy term singleton pregnancies from Rhode Island, USA (n = 222). Concentrations of arsenic (As; median 0.02 ug/g), cadmium (Cd; median 0.03 $\mu$g/g), lead (Pb; median 0.40 $\mu$g/g), manganese (Mn; median 0.56 $\mu$g/g), mercury (Hg; median 0.02 $\mu$g/g), and zinc (Zn; 145.18 $\mu$g/g) measured in infant toenails were categorized as tertiles. Multivariable linear regression models tested the independent associations for each metal with NR3C1 methylation, as well as the cumulative risk of exposure to multiple metals simultaneously. Compared to the lowest exposure tertiles, higher levels of As, Cd, Pb, Mn, and Hg were each associated with increased placental NR3C1 methylation (all P{\textless}0.02). Coefficients for these associations corresponded with a 0.71--1.41 percent increase in NR3C1 methylation per tertile increase in metals concentrations. For Zn, the lowest exposure tertile compared with the highest tertile was associated with 1.26 percent increase in NR3C1 methylation (P=0.01). Higher cumulative metal risk scores were marginally associated with greater NR3C1 methylation. Taken together, these results indicate that prenatal exposure to neurotoxic metals may affect the offspring's NR3C1 activity, which may help explain cognitive and neurodevelopmental risk later in life.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen, and contamination with this heavy metal is of global concern, presenting a major issue in environmental health. However, the mechanism by which arsenic induces cancer is unknown, in large part due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. In the present set of experiments, we focused on dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), a major metabolite of arsenic in most mammals including humans. We provide, for the first time, the full data, including detailed pathology, of the carcinogenicity of DMA in male F344 rats in a 2-year bioassay, along with the first assessment of the genetic alteration patterns in the induced rat urinary bladder tumors. Additionally, to test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a role in DMA carcinogenesis, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in urinary bladder was examined. In experiment 1, a total of 144 male F344 rats at 10 weeks of age were randomly divided into four groups that received DMA at concentrations of 0, 12.5, 50 and 200 p.p.m. in the drinking water, respectively, for 104 weeks. From weeks 97--104, urinary bladder tumors were observed in 8 of 31 and 12 of 31 rats in groups treated with 50 and 200 p.p.m. DMA, respectively, and the preneoplastic lesion, papillary or nodular hyperplasias (PN hyperplasia), was noted in 12 and 14 rats, respectively. DMA treatment did not cause tumors in other organs and no urinary bladder tumors or preneoplastic lesions were evident in the 0 and 12.5 p.p.m.-treated groups. Urinary levels of arsenicals increased significantly in a dose-responsive manner except for arsenobetaine (AsBe). DMA and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO) were the major compounds detected in the urine, with small amounts of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and tetramethylarsonium (TeMa) also detected. Significantly increased 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling indices were observed in the morphologically normal epithelium of the groups treated with 50 and 200 p.p.m. DMA. Mutation analysis showed that DMA-induced rat urinary bladder tumors had a low rate of H-ras mutations (2 of 20, 10{\%}). No alterations of the p53, K-ras or $\beta$-catenin genes were detected. Only one TCC (6{\%}) demonstrated nuclear accumulation of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry. In 16 of 18 (89{\%}) of the TTCs and 3 of 4 (75{\%}) of the papillomas, decreased p27kip1 expression could be demonstrated. Cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in 26 of 47 (55{\%}) PN hyperplasias, 3 of 4 (75{\%}) papillomas, and 10 of 18 (56{\%}) TCCs. As a molecular marker of oxidative stress, increased COX-2 expression was noted in 17 of 18 (94{\%}) TCCs, 4 of 4 (100{\%}) papillomas, and 39 of 47 (83{\%}) PN hyperplasias. In experiment 2, 8-OHdG formation in urinary bladder was significantly increased after treatment with 200 p.p.m. DMA in the drinking water for 2 weeks compared with the controls. The studies demonstrated DMA to be a carcinogen for the rat urinary bladder and suggested that DMA exposure may be relevant to the carcinogenic risk of inorganic arsenic in humans. Diverse genetic alterations observed in DMA-induced urinary bladder tumors imply that multiple genes are involved in stages of DMA-induced tumor development. Furthermore, generation of ROS is likely to play an important role in the early stages of DMA carcinogenesis.},

@misc{Jomova2011,
	abstract = {Detailed studies in the past two decades have shown that redox active metals like iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co) and other metals undergo redox cycling reactions and possess the ability to produce reactive radicals such as superoxide anion radical and nitric oxide in biological systems. Disruption of metal ion homeostasis may lead to oxidative stress, a state where increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms body antioxidant protection and subsequently induces DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein modification and other effects, all symptomatic for numerous diseases, involving cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease), chronic inflammation and others. The underlying mechanism of action for all these metals involves formation of the superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical (mainly via Fenton reaction) and other ROS, finally producing mutagenic and carcinogenic malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and other exocyclic DNA adducts. On the other hand, the redox inactive metals, such as cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) show their toxic effects via bonding to sulphydryl groups of proteins and depletion of glutathione. Interestingly, for arsenic an alternative mechanism of action based on the formation of hydrogen peroxide under physiological conditions has been proposed. A special position among metals is occupied by the redox inert metal zinc (Zn). Zn is an essential component of numerous proteins involved in the defense against oxidative stress. It has been shown, that depletion of Zn may enhance DNA damage via impairments of DNA repair mechanisms. In addition, Zn has an impact on the immune system and possesses neuroprotective properties. The mechanism of metal-induced formation of free radicals is tightly influenced by the action of cellular antioxidants. Many low-molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), glutathione (GSH), carotenoids, flavonoids, and other antioxidants) are capable of chelating metal ions reducing thus their catalytic acitivity to form ROS. A novel therapeutic approach to supress oxidative stress is based on the development of dual function antioxidants comprising not only chelating, but also scavenging components. Parodoxically, two major antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase contain as an integral part of their active sites metal ions to battle against toxic effects of metal-induced free radicals. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of redox and non-redox metal-induced formation of free radicals and the role of oxidative stress in toxic action of metals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {For the world's population, rice consumption is a major source of inorganic arsenic (As), a nonthreshold class 1 carcinogen. Reducing the amount of total and inorganic As within the rice grain would reduce the exposure risk. In this study, grain As was measured in 76 cultivars consisting of Bangladeshi landraces, improved Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) cultivars, and parents of permanent mapping populations grown in two field sites in Bangladesh, Faridpur and Sonargaon, irrigated with As-contaminated tubewell water. Grain As ranged from 0.16 to 0.74 mg kg(-1) at Faridpur and from 0.07 to 0.28 mg kg(-1) at Sonargaon. Highly significant cultivar differences were detected and a significant correlation (r = 0.802) in the grain As between the two field sites was observed, indicating stable genetic differences in As accumulation. The cultivars with the highest concentration of grain As were the Bangladeshi landraces. Landraces with red bran had significantly more grain As than the cultivars with brown bran. The percent of inorganic As decreased linearly with increasing total As, but genetic variation within this trend was identified. A number of local cultivars with low grain As were identified. Some tropical japonica cultivars with low grain As have the potential to be used in breeding programs and genetic studies aiming to identify genes which decrease grain As.},

Specimens of drinking water, blood, urine, hair and toenail were collected from each study subject. Urinary inorganic and methylated arsenic were speciated by high performance liquid chromatography combined with hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. Arsenic concentration in hair and toenail were quantitated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The polymerase chain reaction was used to determine genetic polymorphisms of GST M1 and T1. Arsenic concentrations in urine, hair, and toenail of study subjects were positively correlated with arsenic levels in their drinking water. Percentages of various arsenic species in urine (mean $\pm$ standard error (SE)) were 11.8 $\pm$ 1.0, 26.9 $\pm$ 1.2 and 61.3 $\pm$ 1.4, respectively, for inorganic arsenic, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Men and women had similar arsenic methylation capability. No associations were observed between arsenic methylation capability and arsenic content in either drinking water or urine. Ratios of arsenic contents in hair and toenail to urinary arsenic contert (mean $\pm$ standard error) were 6.2 $\pm$ 0.7 and 16.5 $\pm$ 1.7, respectively. Genetic polymorphisms of GST MI and TI were significantly associated with arsenic methylation. Subjects having the null genotype of GST MI had an increased percentage of inorganic arsenic in urine, while those with null genotype of GST TI had an elevated percentage of DMA in urine. Arsenic contents in hair and toenail were significantly correlated with the increase in arsenic concentrations of drinking water and urine, while no significant associations were observed between arsenic contents in hair and toenail and polymorphisms of GST MI and TI. The relationship between arsenic methylation capability and body retention was modified by genetic polymorphisms of GST M1 and T1. Arsenic contents in hair and toenail were negatively associated with MMA percentage and positively associated with DMA percentage among subjects having null genotypes of GST VII and TI, but not among those with non null genotypes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Arsenic (As) exposure from drinking water is associated with modest intellectual deficits in childhood. It is not known whether reducing exposure is associated with improved intelligence. OBJECTIVE To determine whether reducing As exposure is associated with improved child intellectual outcomes. METHODS Three hundred and three 10-year-old children drinking from household wells with a wide range of As concentrations were enrolled at baseline. In the subsequent year, deep community wells, low in As, were installed in villages of children whose original wells had high water As (WAs ≥50 µg/L). For 296 children, WISC-IV intelligence, using a version modified for the study population, was assessed at baseline and approximately two years later; analyses considered standardized scores for both Full Scale IQ and Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, Processing Speed Indices. Creatinine-adjusted urinary arsenic (UAs/Cr), blood As (BAs) and blood manganese (BMn) were assessed at both times. RESULTS UAs/Cr concentrations declined significantly by follow-up for both the High and Low ({\textless} 50 µg/L) WAs subgroups. At baseline, adjusting for maternal age and intelligence, plasma ferritin, head circumference, home environment quality, school grade and BMn, UAs/Cr was significantly negatively associated with Full Scale IQ, and with all Index scores (except Processing Speed). After adjusting for baseline Working Memory scores and school grade, each 100-µg/g reduction in UAs/Cr from baseline to follow-up was associated with a 0.91 point increase in Working Memory (95{\%} CI: 0.14, 1.67). The change in UAs/Cr across follow-up was not significantly associated with changes in Full Scale IQ or Index scores. CONCLUSIONS Installation of deep, low As, community wells lowered UAs, BAs and BMn. A greater decrease in UAs/Cr was associated with greater improvements in Working Memory scores, but not with a greater improvement in Full Scale IQ.},

	abstract = {Background: Symptom-based questionnaires can be a cost effective tool enabling identification and diagnosis of patients with respiratory illnesses in resource limited setting. This study aimed to determine the correlation of respiratory symptoms and spirometric lung patterns and validity of ATS respiratory questionnaire in a rural community setting.Methods: This cross sectional survey was conducted between January - March 2009 on a sample of 200 adults selected from two villages of district Khairpur, Sindh, Pakistan. A modified version of the American thoracic society division of lung disease questionnaire was used to record the presence of respiratory symptoms. Predicted lung volumes i.e. forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and their ratio (FEV1/FVC) were recorded using portable spirometer.Results: In the study sample there were 91 (45.5{\%}) males and 109 (54.5{\%}) females with overall mean age of 34 years ($\pm$11.69). Predominant respiratory symptom was phlegm (19{\%}) followed by cough (17.5{\%}), wheeze (14{\%}) and dyspnea (10.5{\%}). Prevalence of physician diagnosed and self-reported asthma was 5.5{\%} and 9.5{\%} respectively. Frequency of obstructive pattern on spirometry was 28.72{\%} and that of restrictive pattern was 19.68{\%}. After adjustment for age, gender, socioeconomic status, spoken dialect, education, smoking status, height, weight and arsenic in drinking water, FVC was significantly reduced for phlegm (OR 3.01; 95{\%} CI: 1.14 - 7.94), wheeze (OR 7.22; 95{\%} CI: 2.52 - 20.67) and shortness of breath (OR 4.91; 95{\%} CI: 1.57 - 15.36); and FEV1 was significantly reduced for cough (OR 2.69; 95{\%} CI: 1.12 - 6.43), phlegm (OR 3.01; 95{\%} CI: 1.26 - 7.16) and wheeze (OR 10.77; 95{\%} CI: 3.45 - 33.6). Presence of respiratory symptoms was significantly associated with restrictive and/or obstructive patterns after controlling for confounders. Similar findings were observed through linear regression where respiratory symptoms were found to be significantly associated with decrements in lung volumes. Specificity and positive predictive values were found to be higher for all the symptoms compared to sensitivity and negative predictive values.Conclusion: Symptoms based respiratory questionnaires are a valuable tool for screening of respiratory symptoms in resource poor, rural community setting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Abbasi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Microbiological studies have always had an important role in the evaluation of drinking water quality. However, since geological processes are the most important factors controlling the source and distribution of chemical elements in natural waters, the importance of geochemical data must not be underestimated. This study presents data on pH, conductivity and concentrations of 69 elements and ions (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ge, Hf, Hg, Ho, I, K, La, Li, Lu, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zn, Zr, Br-, HCO3

-, NO3
-, PO4
3-, SO4
2-, SiO2) from 186 bottled mineral waters of 158 different Italian name brands. Analyses show a large range in concentrations for most of these elements, with variations up to four orders of magnitude. Our data demonstrate that some elements (such as Be), generally considered unlikely to occur, can instead reach surprisingly high levels in drinking water, and also how packaging can release some trace elements to the bottled water. Data analysis shows that the implementation of an international database of bottled water geochemistry and of potential toxicological effects is of paramount importance to provide a robust data set which would be useful to set international action levels and guidelines to secure bottled water quality, whose consumption has steadily increased in the recent years. A new formula to calculate nitrate and nitrite tolerable concentration levels in waters intended for human consumption is proposed, to take into account that about 5{\%} of dietary nitrate in humans is converted to nitrite. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Dauphine2011,
	abstract = {Purpose: Evidence suggests that arsenic in drinking water causes non-malignant lung disease, but nearly all data concern exposed adults. The desert city of Antofagasta (population 257,976) in northern Chile had high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water ({\textgreater}800 $\mu$g/l) from 1958 until 1970, when a new treatment plant was installed. This scenario, with its large population, distinct period of high exposure, and accurate data on past exposure, is virtually unprecedented in environmental epidemiology. We conducted a pilot study on early-life arsenic exposure and long-term lung function. We present these preliminary findings because of the magnitude of the effects observed. Methods: We recruited a convenience sample consisting primarily of nursing school employees in Antofagasta and Arica, a city with low drinking water arsenic. Lung function and respiratory symptoms in 32 adults exposed to {\textgreater}800 $\mu$g/l arsenic before age 10 were compared to 65 adults without high early-life exposure. Results: Early-life arsenic exposure was associated with 11.5{\%} lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) (P = 0.04), 12.2{\%} lower forced vital capacity (FVC) (P = 0.04), and increased breathlessness (prevalence odds ratio = 5.94, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.36-26.0). Exposure-response relationships between early-life arsenic concentration and adult FEV 1 and FVC were also identified (P trend = 0.03). Conclusions: Early-life exposure to arsenic in drinking water may have irreversible respiratory effects of a magnitude similar to smoking throughout adulthood. Given the small study size and non-random recruitment methods, further research is needed to confirm these findings. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

The surveyed rice samples were grouped according to their country of origin into four different regions namely Asia, Europe, Middle East, and North America. The samples were analyzed for total arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data showed that the highest geometric means (GMs) of total As, Cd, Pb, and Hg contents were in rice samples imported from Europe, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, respectively. The total As, Cd, Pb, and Hg concentrations in the analyzed rice samples were compared to the heavy metal content of 5800 rice samples from 25 different countries reported in the literature; furthermore, the heavy metal (total As, Cd, Pb, and Hg) concentrations determined in this study were implemented to calculate the daily dietary intake of toxic metals for the general population in the state of Kuwait, while the collected ones from the literature were implemented to calculate and then compare the daily dietary intake of toxic metals for the general population in 29 different countries around the world.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is ubiquitous in the environment as arsenite (AsIII) and arsenate (AsV) compounds and biotransformation of these toxic chemicals leads to the extraordinary variety of organoarsenic species found in nature. Despite classification as a human carcinogen based on data from populations exposed through contaminated drinking water, only recently has a need for regulatory limits on iAs in food been recognized. The delay was due to the difficulty in risk assessment of dietary iAs, which critically relies on speciation analysis providing occurrence data for iAs in food -- and not simply for total arsenic. In the present review the state of knowledge regarding arsenic speciation in food and diet is evaluated with focus on iAs and human exposure assessment through different dietary approaches including duplicate diet studies, market basket surveys, and total diet studies. The analytical requirements for obtaining reliable data for iAs in food are discussed and iAs levels in foods and beverages are summarized, along with information on other (potentially) toxic co-occurring organoarsenic compounds. Quantitative exposure assessment of iAs in food is addressed, focusing on the need of capturing variability and extent of exposure and identifying what dietary items drive very high exposure for certain population groups. Finally, gaps and uncertainties are discussed, including effect of processing and cooking, and iAs bioavailability.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify occupations with excess bladder cancer risk in New Hampshire, where bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated for decades. METHODS: Lifetime occupational histories were obtained from interviews with 424 cases and 645 controls in a population-based case-control study. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (Ors) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) for each occupation, adjusted for age and smoking. Analyses by duration of employment were carried out and interactions with smoking were examined. RESULTS: Male tractor-trailer truck drivers had an elevated risk for bladder cancer (OR = 2.4, CI = 1.4-4.1), with a significant positive trend in risk with increasing duration of employment (P (trend) = 0.0003). Male metal/plastic processing machine operators also had a significant excess (OR = 4.9, CI = 1.6-15.1), attributable mainly to molding/casting machine operators (OR = 16.6, CI = 2.1-131). Elevated risk was also observed for male fabricators, assemblers, and hand workers (OR = 1.8, CI = 1.0-3.4). Women in certain sales occupations (sales clerks, counter clerks, and cashiers) had a significant excess risk (OR = 2.2, CI = 1.3-3.9) and a significant trend with duration of employment (P (trend) = 0.016), as did female health service workers (OR = 4.1, CI = 1.6-10.7; P (trend) = 0.014). There was a positive interaction between smoking and employment as a health service worker (p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are generally consistent with previous studies. Elevated risks for male molding/casting machine operators, female salesworkers, and female health service workers, especially those with a history of smoking, require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Exposure to air pollution during infancy has been related to lung function decrements in 8-year-old children, but whether the negative effects remain into adolescence is unknown. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and lung function up to age 16 years. Methods: A total of 2,278 children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological Survey) performed spirometry at age 16 years. Levels of outdoor air pollution from local road traffic were estimated (nitrogen oxides [NOx] and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of {\textless} 10 $\mu$m [PM10]) for residential, daycare, and school addresses during the lifetime using dispersion modeling. Associations between exposure in different time windows and spirometry indexes were analyzed by linear regression and mixed effect models. Measurements and Main Results: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution during the first year of life was associated with FEV1 at age 16 years of 215.8 ml (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 233.6 to 2.0 for a 10 $\mu$g/m3 difference in NOx), predominately in males (230.4 ml; 95{\%} CI, 259.1 to 21.7), and in subjects not exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy or infancy. Later exposures appeared to have had an additional negative effect. High exposure during the first year of life was also associated with odds ratios for FEV1 and FVC less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) (defined as a z-score {\textless} 21.64 SD) of 3.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.3-10.9) and of 4.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-15.0), respectively. The results for PM10 were similar to those for NOx. Conclusions: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution in infancy is negatively associated with FEV1 at age 16 years, leading to increased risk of clinically important deficits.},

	abstract = {Nail and hair are rich in fibrous proteins, i.e., $\alpha$-keratins that contain abundant cysteine residues (up to 22{\%} in nail and 10-14{\%} in hair). Although they are metabolically dead materials in the epidermis, the roots are highly influenced by the health status of the living beings and their analyses are used as a tool to monitor occupational and environmental exposure to toxic elements. The aims of the present study are to speciate arsenicals in human nail and hair and also to judge whether they should be used as a biomarker to arsenic (As) exposure and/or toxicity. All human fingernail and hair samples (n = 47) were collected from the As-affected area of West Bengal, India. Speciation of arsenicals in water extracts of fingernails and hair at 90$\,^{\circ}$C was carried out by HPLC-inductively coupled argon plasma mass spectrometer (ICP MS). Fingernails contained iAsIII (58.6{\%}), iAsV (21.5), MMAV (7.7), DMAIII (9.2), and DMAV (3.0), and hair contained iAsIII (60.9{\%}), iAsV (33.2), MMAV (2.2), and DMAV (3.6). Fingernails contained DMAIII, but hair did not. The higher percentage of iAsIII both in fingernails and hair than that of iAsV suggests more affinity of iAsIII to keratin. Although all arsenicals in fingernails and hair correlate to As exposure positively, As speciation in fingernails seems to be more correlated with arsenism than that in hair. Exogenous contamination is a confounding factor for hair to consider it as a biomarker, whereas this is mostly absent in fingernails, which recommends it to be a better biomarker to arsenic exposure. DMAIII content in fingernails and DMAV contents in both fingernails and hair could be the biomarker to As exposure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A three-year-old child died after ingestion of a mouthful of an estimated 44{\%} sodium arsenite solution. Litigation was initiated based on the quality of emergency treatment at a rural hospital. An issue raised in litigation was whether the child could have survived if he had received an additional dose of BAL (dimercaprol). BAL had been sent for from a neighboring city and arrived approximately 2.0 h after admission. The first 50-mg dose of BAL could have combined with a maximum of 30 mg arsenic; a second dose could have brought the total of chelated arsenic to 60 mg. To determine the total body burden of arsenic in the child, multiple tissues were analyzed. The total body burden was estimated at 113 mg, with 100 mg of this total attributable to the ingested solution. The actual body burden after two doses of BAL therefore would have been at least 40 mg, a fatal level. {\textcopyright} 1989 Journal of Analytical Toxicology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background Preterm birth is a disease of multifactorial etiologies that has environmental, social, and maternal health components. Individual studies have shown that exposure to arsenic contaminated drinking water, child marriage, and low maternal weight gain during pregnancy contribute to preterm birth. These factors are highly prevalent and often co-exist in Bangladesh, a country in South Asia with one of the world's highest prevalences of preterm birth. Objective To evaluate the individual and interactive effects of prenatal arsenic exposure, child marriage, and pregnancy weight gain on preterm birth in a prospective birth cohort in Bangladesh. Methods During 2008--2011, we recruited 1613 pregnant women aged ≥ 18 years at ≤ 16 weeks of gestation and followed them until 1-month post-partum. We measured total arsenic in drinking water (n = 1184) and in maternal toenails (n = 1115) collected at enrollment and ≤ 1-month post-partum, respectively using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Child marriage ({\textless} 18 years old) was defined using self-report, and 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnancy weight gain was calculated using monthly records. Gestational age was determined at enrollment by ultrasound. Results In multivariate adjusted Poisson regression models, the risk ratios (RR) for preterm birth were 1.12 (95{\%} CI: 1.07--1.18) for a unit change in natural log water arsenic exposure, 2.28 (95{\%} CI: 1.76--2.95) for child marriage, and 0.64 (95{\%} CI: 0.42--0.97) for a pound per week increase in maternal weight during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. In stratified analysis by child marriage, pregnancy weight gain was inversely associated with preterm birth among women with a history of child marriage (RR = 0.58; 95{\%} CI: 0.37--0.92), but not among women with no history of child marriage (RR = 86; 95{\%} CI: 0.37--2.01). Mediation analysis revealed that both arsenic exposure and child marriage had small but significant associations with preterm birth via lowering pregnancy weight gain. Similar associations were observed when arsenic exposure was assessed using maternal toenail arsenic concentrations. Conclusions Reducing arsenic exposure and ending child marriage could reduce the risk of preterm birth in Bangladesh. Furthermore, enhancing nutritional support to ensure adequate weight gain during pregnancy may provide additional benefits especially for women with a history of child marriage.},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence indicates a potential role of selenium in the prevention of several types of cancer, including bladder cancer. We investigated the association between toenail selenium concentrations and bladder cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in New Hampshire. We analyzed data from 857 incidence cases diagnosed between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 2001 and 1,191 general population controls. Newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were identified from the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry, which operates a rapid reporting system. Controls were selected from population lists (driver's license and Medicare enrollment). We used logistic regression analyses to generate odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI), controlling for age, sex, and pack-years of smoking and conducted separate analyses according to the intensity of p53 immunohistochemical staining of the tumor. Overall, toenail selenium concentrations were not significantly related to bladder cancer [OR Q4 versus Q1, 0.90 (95{\%} CI, 0.68-1.19); P(trend) = 0.15]. However, within specific subgroups there were inverse associations, i.e., among moderate smokers [OR, 0.61 (95{\%} CI, 0.39-0.96); P(trend) = 0.004], women [OR, 0.66 (95{\%} CI, 0.40-1.10); P(trend) = 0.11], and those with p53-positive cancers [OR Q4 versus Q1, 0.57 (95{\%} CI, 0.34-0.94); P(trend) = 0.01]. Our results indicate that selenium is not inversely related to risk of bladder cancer overall; however, they raise the possibility that selenium may be preventive in certain molecular phenotypes of tumors (e.g., p53 positive) or within certain subsets of a population (e.g., women or moderate smokers).},

@article{Howe2014,
	abstract = {Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (InAs) through drinking water is a major problem worldwide. InAs undergoes hepatic methylation to form mono- and dimethyl arsenical species (MMA and DMA, respectively), facilitating arsenic elimination. Both reactions are catalyzed by arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) using S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the methyl donor, yielding the methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent product-inhibitor of AS3MT. SAM biosynthesis depends on folate- and cobalamin-dependent one-carbon metabolism. With the use of samples from 353 participants in the Folate and Oxidative Stress Study, our objective was to test the hypotheses that blood SAM and SAH concentrations are associated with arsenic methylation and that these associations differ by folate and cobalamin nutritional status. Blood SAM and SAH were measured by HPLC. Arsenic metabolites in blood and urine were measured by HPLC coupled to dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled plasma MS. In linear regression analyses, SAH was not associated with any of the arsenic metabolites. However, log(SAM) was negatively associated with log({\%} urinary InAs) ($\beta$: -0.11; 95{\%} CI: -0.19, -0.02; P = 0.01), and folate and cobalamin nutritional status significantly modified associations between SAM and percentage of blood MMA ({\%}bMMA) and percentage of blood DMA ({\%}bDMA) (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). In folate- and cobalamin-deficient individuals, log(SAM) was positively associated with {\%}bMMA ($\beta$: 6.96; 95{\%} CI: 1.86, 12.05; P {\textless} 0.01) and negatively associated with {\%}bDMA ($\beta$: -6.19; 95{\%} CI: -12.71, 0.32; P = 0.06). These findings suggest that when exposure to InAs is high, and methyl groups are limiting, SAM is used primarily for MMA synthesis rather than for DMA synthesis, contributing additional evidence that nutritional status may explain some of the interindividual differences in arsenic metabolism and, consequently, susceptibility to arsenic toxicity.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest adverse effects of arsenic exposure on children's cognitive function. In this study, we examined the potential association between arsenic exposure and children's behavior. Five hundred and twenty-six children, 6-7 years old, living near a metal foundry in Torre??n, Mexico, participated in the study. Arsenic exposure was measured as total urinary arsenic (UAs) and arsenic metabolites-monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) concentrations. Children's behavior was assessed by Conners Behavior Rating Scales for parents and teachers. The median (interquartile range) concentrations of UAs, MMA and DMA were 55.2 (39.7), 6.7 (5.9) and 39.3 (28.5) ??g/L, respectively. The mean behavior scores from parent and teacher ratings were within the clinically normal range (T{\textless}65). The relationship between behavior and urinary arsenic was modeled in linear and logistic regression models, with UAs, MMA and DMA tested in separate models and entered as quartiles. No significant association was found between any measure of urinary arsenic and parent ratings of behavior. However, higher UAs was modestly associated with higher scores on the Oppositional, Cognitive Problems and ADHD sub-scales of the teacher ratings; a dose-response relationship was not established between UAs quartiles and behavior. Higher urinary DMA was associated with higher ratings on the Oppositional, Cognitive Problems and ADHD Index by teachers. The associations between UAs and behavior became statistically non-significant after adjustment for the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, suggesting that the harmful effects of arsenic on behavior may be secondary to arsenic-induced cognitive deficits. These data suggest a potential adverse association between arsenic and children's behavior and indicate a need to further study the effects of arsenic and arsenic metabolites on neurobehavioral outcomes in children. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

By contrast, in upper middle income and high-income countries noncommunicable diseases predominate. To examine patterns of environmental exposure and disease and to relate these patterns to levels of income and development, we obtained publically available data in 12 countries at different levels of development through a global network of World Health Organization Collaborating Centres in Children's Environmental Health. Pollution exposures in early life contribute to both patterns. Chemical and pesticide pollution are increasing, especially in LMICs. Hazardous wastes, including electronic waste, are accumulating.

	abstract = {Lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and fluoride (F) exposure during childhood is of concern owing to their toxicity. Also, evidence suggests that high and low exposure levels to manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se) during this vulnerable period are associated with an increased risk of adverse health effects. A reduced growth is associated with high Pb and F exposure; however, little is known about their impact on children's body size, and there is a lack of consensus on the effects of Hg, Mn, and Se exposure on children's anthropometric measures. This is particularly true for childhood metal co-exposures at levels relevant to the general population. We investigated the joint effects of exposure to a metal mixture (Pb, Mn, Hg, and Se in blood and F in plasma) on 6--11-year-old US children's anthropometry (n = 1634). Median F, Pb, Mn, Hg, and Se concentrations were 0.3 µmol/L, 0.5 µg/dL, 10.2 µg/L, 0.3 µg/L, and 178.0 µg/L, respectively. The joint effects of the five metals were modeled using Bayesian kernel machine and linear regressions. Pb and Mn showed opposite directions of associations with all outcome measured, where Pb was inversely associated with anthropometry. For body mass index and waist circumference, the effect estimates for Pb and Mn appeared stronger at high and low concentrations of the other metals of the mixture, respectively. Our findings suggest that metal co-exposures may influence children's body mass and linear growth indicators, and that such relations may differ by the exposure levels of the components of the metal mixture.},

	abstract = {This study aims at evaluating the suitability of adjusting urinary concentrations of arsenic, or any other urinary biomarker, for variations in urine dilution by creatinine and specific gravity in a malnourished population. We measured the concentrations of metabolites of inorganic arsenic, creatinine and specific gravity in spot urine samples collected from 1466 individuals, 5--88 years of age, in Matlab, rural Bangladesh, where arsenic-contaminated drinking water and malnutrition are prevalent (about 30{\%} of the adults had body mass index (BMI) below 18.5 kg/m 2). The urinary concentrations of creatinine were low; on average 0.55 g/L in the adolescents and adults and about 0.35 g/L in the 5--12 years old children. Therefore, adjustment by creatinine gave much higher numerical values for the urinary arsenic concentrations than did the corresponding data expressed as mg/L, adjusted by specific gravity. As evaluated by multiple regression analyses, urinary creatinine, adjusted by specific gravity, was more affected by body size, age, gender and season than was specific gravity. Furthermore, urinary creatinine was found to be significantly associated with urinary arsenic, which further disqualifies the creatinine adjustment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide levels of total and speciated urinary arsenic in a representative sample of the US population. METHODS: For the first time, total arsenic and seven inorganic and organic arsenic species were measured in the urine of participants (n=2557) for the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data were compiled as geometric means and selected percentiles of urinary arsenic concentrations (microg/l) and creatinine-corrected urinary arsenic (microg/g creatinine) for total arsenic, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenobetaine, and a sum of the inorganic related species. RESULTS: Arsenic acid, arsenous acid, arsenocholine, and trimethylarsine oxide were detected in 7.6{\%}, 4.6{\%}, 1.8{\%}, and 0.3{\%} of the participants, respectively (the limits of detection of 0.6-1.2 microg/l). Monomethylarsonic acid was detected in 35{\%} of the overall population. For all participants aged {\textgreater} or =6 years, dimethylarsinic acid (geometric mean of 3.71 microg/l) and arsenobetaine (geometric mean of 1.55 microg/l) had the greatest contribution to the total urinary arsenic levels. A relatively greater percentage contribution from arsenobetaine is seen at higher total urinary arsenic levels and from dimethylarsinic acid at lower total urinary arsenic levels. For all participants aged {\textgreater} or =6 years, the 95th percentiles for total urinary arsenic and the sum of inorganic-related arsenic (arsenic acid, arsenous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid) were 65.4 and 18.9 microg/l, respectively. For total arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid, covariate-adjusted geometric means demonstrated several slight differences due to age, gender, and race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: The data reflect relative background contributions of inorganic and seafood-related arsenic exposures in the US population. Arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid are the major arsenic species present with arsenobetaine, accounting for a greater proportion of total arsenic as total arsenic levels increase.},

Following exposure, cadmium accumulates in the kidney and is slowly released into the urine, usually proportionally to the levels found in the kidneys. Cadmium levels in a single spot urine sample have been considered indicative of long-term exposure to cadmium; however, such a potentially exceptional biomarker requires careful scrutiny. In this review, we report good to excellent temporal stability of urinary cadmium (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.66--0.81) regardless of spot urine or first morning void sampling. Factors such as changes in smoking habits and diseases characterized by increased excretion of proteins may produce short-term changes in urinary cadmium levels. We recommend that epidemiologists use this powerful biomarker in prospective studies stratified by smoking status, along with thoughtful consideration of additional factors that can influence renal physiology and cadmium excretion.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Chronic arsenic poisoning, due to ingestion of contaminated ground-water, is a major public health problem in West Bengal. It causes multiorgan damage. The present study attempts to objectively investigate the pulmonary involvement by examining the lung function. The nature of lung changes was also evaluated. Material and Methods: One hundred and seven subjects with (cases) and 52 subjects without (controls) chronic arsenic poisoning were examined by spirometry. Forced expiratory volume-1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in five cases with and five cases without pulmonary involvement. Results: Thirty three (30.8{\%}) cases and four (7.6{\%}) controls (p{\textless}0.01) had respiratory involvement. The pattern of involvement in cases was: obstructive- 20(68.9{\%}) (including three (10{\%}) with bronchiectasis), restrictive- 1(3.5{\%}), mixed- 8(27.6{\%}), malignancy- 4(12.1{\%})(adenocarcinoma- 1, squamous cell- 2, undifferentiated- 1). FEV1 (69.7$\pm$25.9 [n=105] vs 83.7$\pm$15.19 [n=51], p=0.0005), FVC (77.4$\pm$22.7 [n=105] vs 85.6$\pm$18.23 [n=51], p=0.025), FEV1/FVC (73.6$\pm$13.38 [n=105] vs 79.1$\pm$18.65 [n=52], p=0.007) and PEFR (53.9$\pm$21.52 [n=103] vs 67.3$\pm$18.36 [n=51], p=0.0002) (percent of predicted) were all reduced more in cases compared to controls. Worsening of these parameters correlated with increasing degree of arsenic toxicity. Markers of inflammation (macrophage, lactate dehydrogenase, nitric oxide) were apparently more in the BAL fluid of those with lung involvement than in those without, though the arsenic content did not differ significantly. Conclusion: Chronic arsenic poisoning causes pulmonary involvement, predominantly obstructive, the degree of which worsens with increasing degree of arsenic toxicity. Inflammation, rather than direct toxicity, appears to be the underlying mechanism. {\textcopyright} JAPI 2004.},

@article{Dummer2015,
	abstract = {Arsenic is a naturally occurring class 1 human carcinogen that is widespread in private drinking water wells throughout the province of Nova Scotia in Canada. In this paper we explore the spatial variation in toenail arsenic concentrations (arsenic body burden) in Nova Scotia. We describe the regional distribution of arsenic concentrations in private well water supplies in the province, and evaluate the geological and environmental features associated with higher levels of arsenic in well water. We develop geostatistical process models to predict high toenail arsenic concentrations and high well water arsenic concentrations, which have utility for studies where no direct measurements of arsenic body burden or arsenic exposure are available. 892 men and women who participated in the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health Project provided both drinking water and toenail clipping samples. Information on socio-demographic, lifestyle and health factors was obtained with a set of standardized questionnaires. Anthropometric indices and arsenic concentrations in drinking water and toenails were measured. In addition, data on arsenic concentrations in 10,498 private wells were provided by the Nova Scotia Department of Environment. We utilised stepwise multivariable logistic regression modelling to develop separate statistical models to: a) predict high toenail arsenic concentrations (defined as toenail arsenic levels ≥0.12$\mu$gg-1) and b) predict high well water arsenic concentrations (defined as well water arsenic levels ≥5.0$\mu$gL-1). We found that the geological and environmental information that predicted well water arsenic concentrations can also be used to accurately predict toenail arsenic concentrations. We conclude that geological and environmental factors contributing to arsenic contamination in well water are the major contributing influences on arsenic body burden among Nova Scotia residents. Further studies are warranted to assess appropriate intervention strategies for reducing arsenic body burden among human populations.},

	abstract = {Biomarker use in exposure assessment is increasingly common, and consideration of related issues is of growing importance. Exposure quantification may be compromised when measurement is subject to a lower threshold. Statistical modeling of such data requires a decision regarding the handling of such readings. Various authors have considered this problem. In the context of linear regression analysis, Richardson and Ciampi (Am J Epidemiol 2003;157:355-63) proposed replacement of data below a threshold by a constant equal to the expectation for such data to yield unbiased estimates. Use of such an imputation has some limitations; distributional assumptions are required, and bias reduction in estimation of regression parameters is asymptotic, thereby presenting concerns about small studies. In this paper, the authors propose distribution-free methods for managing values below detection limits and evaluate the biases that may result when exposure measurement is constrained by a lower threshold. The authors utilize an analytical approach and a simulation study to assess the effects of the proposed replacement method on estimates. These results may inform decisions regarding analytical plans for future studies and provide a possible explanation for some amount of the discordance seen in extant literature.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of people are at risk from the adverse effects of arsenic exposure through drinking water. Increasingly, non-cancer effects such as cardiovascular disease have been associated with drinking water arsenic exposures. However, most studies have been conducted in highly exposed populations and lacked individual measurements.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between cardiovascular disease and well-water arsenic exposure.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a hospital based case control study in Inner Mongolia, China. Cases and controls were prospectively identified and enrolled from a large hospital in the Hangjin Hou area. Cases were patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and controls were patients free from cardiovascular disease, admitted for conditions unrelated to arsenic exposure. Water from the primary water source and toenail samples were collected from each subject and tested for inorganic arsenic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Arsenic exposures were moderate with mean and median arsenic exposures of 8.9 $\mu$g/L and 13.1 $\mu$g/L, respectively. A total of 298 cases and 275 controls were enrolled. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and corresponding 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) for a 10 $\mu$g/L increase in water arsenic were 1.19 (95{\%} CI: 1.03, 1.38). Compared to exposures less than 10 $\mu$g/L, the AOR for water arsenic exposures above 40 $\mu$g/L was 4.05 (95{\%} CI: 1.1-14.99, p = 0.04). Nail arsenic above 1.38 $\mu$g/g was also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By using standardized case definitions and collecting individual measurements of arsenic, this study addressed several limitations of previous studies. The results provide further evidence of the association between cardiovascular disease and arsenic at moderate exposures.},

A study was conducted to investigate the effect of increased organic matter in the soil on the release of arsenic into soil pore water and accumulation of arsenic species within rice grain. It was observed that high concentrations of soil arsenic and organic matter caused a reduction in plant growth and delayed flowering time. Total grain arsenic accumulation was higher in the plants grown in high soil arsenic in combination with high organic matter, with an increase in the percentage of organic arsenic species observed. The results indicate that the application of organic matter should be done with caution in paddy soils which have high soil arsenic, as this may lead to an increase in accumulation of arsenic within rice grains. Results also confirm that flooding conditions substantially increase grain arsenic. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure is a worldwide health problem. How arsenic exposure promotes a variety of diseases is poorly understood, and specific relationships between experimental and human exposures are not established. We propose pheno typic anchoring as a means to unify experimental observations and disease outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We examined the use of pheno typic anchors to translate experimental data to human pathology and investigated research needs for which pheno typic anchors need to be developed. METHODS: During a workshop, we discussed experimental systems investigating arsenic dose/ exposure and pheno typic expression relationships and human disease responses to chronic arsenic exposure and identified knowledge gaps. In a literature review, we identified areas where data exist to support pheno typic anchoring of experimental results to pathologies from specific human exposures. DISCUSSION: Disease outcome is likely dependent on cell-type--specific responses and inter action with individual genetics, other toxicants, and infectious agents. Potential pheno typic anchors include target tissue dosimetry, gene expression and epigenetic profiles, and tissue biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Translation to human populations requires more extensive profiling of human samples along with high-quality dosimetry. Anchoring results by gene expression and epigenetic profiling has great promise for data unification. Genetic predisposition of individuals affects disease outcome. Interactions with infectious agents, particularly viruses, may explain some species-specific differences between human pathologies and experimental animal pathologies. Invertebrate systems amenable to genetic manipulation offer potential for elaborating impacts of specific biochemical pathways. Anchoring experimental results to specific human exposures will accelerate understanding of mechanisms of arsenic-induced human disease. KEY WORDS: arsenic, biomarkers, dosimetry, epigene},

	abstract = {In the Panasqueira mine area of central Portugal, some environmental media show higher metal(loid) concentrations when compared with the local geochemical background and the values proposed in the literature for these environmental media. In order to evaluate the effect of the external contamination on selected indexes of internal dose, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, Si, and Zn were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry in blood, urine, hair and nail samples from individuals environmentally (N = 41) and occupationally exposed (N = 41). A matched control group (N = 40) was also studied, and data from the three groups were compared. Results obtained agreed with those reported by environmental studies performed in this area, pointing to populations living nearby and working in the mine being exposed to metal(loid)s originated from mining activities. Arsenic was the element with the highest increase in exposed populations. The concentration of other elements such as Cr, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, S, Se, and Zn was also increased, although at a lesser extent, specifically in the individuals environmentally exposed and in females. These findings confirm the need for competent authorities to act as soon as possible in this area and implement strategies aimed to protect exposed populations and the entire ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease that has increased in prevalence in many industrialised countries. However, the causes of asthma inception remain elusive. Consideration of sub-phenotypes of wheezing may reveal important clues to aetiological risk factors. Methods: Longitudinal phenotypes capturing population heterogeneity in wheezing reports from birth to 7 years were derived using latent class analysis in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Probability of class membership was used to examine the association between five wheezing phenotypes (transient early, prolonged early, intermediate-onset, late-onset, persistent) and early life risk factors for asthma. Results: Phenotypes had similar patterns and strengths of associations with early environmental factors. Comparing transient early with prolonged early wheezing showed a similar pattern of association with most exposure variables considered in terms of the direction of the effect estimates but with prolonged early wheezing tending to have stronger associations than transient early wheezing except for parity and day care attendance. Conclusions: Associations with early life risk factors suggested that prolonged early wheeze might be a severe form of transient early wheezing. Although differences were found in the associations of early life risk factors with individual phenotypes, these did not point to novel aetiological pathways. Persistent wheezing phenotype has features suggesting overlap of early and late-onset phenotypes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Granell et al.},

	abstract = {The present study aims at assessing arsenic (As) levels in outdoor dust and human exposure risks at different land use setting (i.e., rural, industrial, urban) from Punjab, Pakistan. The results showed higher As concentrations (mg/kg) in all the sample types (i.e., dust, hair and nail) collected from industrial sites (9.78, 2.36, 2.5) followed by urban (7.59, 0.38, 0.88) and rural sites (6.95, 0.52, 1.12), respectively. In the current study, we also carried out human risk assessment via contaminated dust exposure, which suggested that dust ingestion is the major route of As contamination for the associated population, followed by the inhalation and dermal contact, at all studied land use settings. Hazard Index (HI) calculated for non-carcinogenic health risks for adults showed higher values at industrial (0.65) and urban (0.53) sites, which reflected that dust exposure is the major contributing source of human arsenic burden and may pose several adverse health effects. Carcinogenic risk values showed that at industrial areas the risk of carcinogenesis to the associated population is mainly due to As contaminated dust exposure. Hair (60{\%}) and nail samples (70{\%}) collected from industrial land use were found above the WHO threshold limit of 1. mg/kg, suggested high risks for human health in the studied area. The results of the present study would be useful for assessing the human health risks due to arsenic contamination via dust exposure in different parts of country.},

	abstract = {Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is critical for human health and development. At the turn of the century when diets were based on whole grains, cereals and other traditional foods, Mn intakes (8--9 mg/d) were much greater than that prevalent today (2 mg/d). As societies have developed, diets have shifted as part of a nutrition transition, to those that are high in processed foods, fat, and sugar. These foods are virtually devoid of Mn. Thus, dietary Mn has declined substantially throughout the world, as confirmed by several wide-scale, total diet studies. International variability in dietary Mn is considerable, due to tremendous diversity in food and culture. In countries where fruit and vegetable intake may be limited, i.e. the United Kingdom, populations may ingest much lower levels of Mn (1.4 mg/d) as compared to Asian cultures (4 mg/d) which have an abundance of plant foods in their food supply and cuisine. The bioavailability of Mn must be considered, including chemical form, oxidation state, mineral-mineral interactions, presence of dietary components and traditional food processing techniques (milling, germination, malting, fermentation). Manganese toxicity is a public health problem that results from exposure to a naturally high water source or contaminated environment of the soil and/or drinking water. In contrast, inadequate intake is associated with adverse health effects such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, poor birth outcomes and possibly, cancer. Future studies are recommended to set dietary standards for this mineral in countries that lack recommendations to help achieve optimal health.},

The aim of this study was to elucidate potential impact on birth anthropometry of exposure to Cd, Pb, and Hg in pregnant women, and to identify the main dietary sources. In the NICE (Nutritional impact on Immunological maturation during Childhood in relation to the Environment) birth-cohort in northern Sweden, blood and urine were collected from pregnant women in early third trimester. Cd, Pb and Hg were measured in erythrocytes (n = 584), and Cd also in urine (n = 581), by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Dietary data were collected through a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire administered in mid-third trimester. Birth anthropometry data were extracted from hospital records. In multivariable-adjusted spline regression models, a doubling of maternal erythrocyte Cd (median: 0.29 $\mu$g/kg) above the spline knot of 0.50 $\mu$g/kg was associated with reduced birth weight (B: −191 g; 95{\%} CI: −315, −68) and length (−0.67 cm; −1.2, −0.14). The association with birth weight remained when the analysis was restricted to never-smokers. Likewise, a doubling of erythrocyte Hg (median 1.5 $\mu$g/kg, mainly MeHg) above 1.0 $\mu$g/kg, was associated with decreased birth weight (−59 g; −115, −3.0), and length (−0.29 cm; −0.54, −0.047). Maternal Pb (median 11 $\mu$g/kg) was unrelated to birth weight and length. Erythrocyte Cd was primarily associated with intake of plant derived foods, Pb with game meat, tea and coffee, and Hg with fish. The results indicated that low-level maternal Cd and Hg exposure were associated with poorer birth anthropometry. Further prospective studies in low-level exposed populations are warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss current evidence about the relation between prenatal and childhood Mediterranean diet, and the development of asthma and allergies in children. DESIGN: Review of the literature. SETTING AND RESULTS: Four recent studies conducted in Mediterranean countries (Spain, Greece) and one conducted in Mexico evaluated the association between childhood Mediterranean diet and asthma outcomes in children. All of the studies reported beneficial associations between a high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet during childhood and symptoms of asthma or allergic rhinitis. Individual foods or food groups contributing to the protective effect of Mediterranean diet included fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and cereals, while detrimental components included red meat, margarine and junk food intake. Two studies focused on prenatal Mediterranean diet: the first is a birth cohort in Spain that showed a protective effect of a high adherence to the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy on persistent wheeze, atopic wheeze and atopy at the age of 6.5 years; while the second is a cross-sectional study in Mexico, collecting information more than 6 years after pregnancy, that showed no associations between maternal Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and allergic symptoms in childhood except for current sneezing. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from recent studies suggest that a high level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet early in life protects against the development of asthma and atopy in children. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of this protective effect, to evaluate the most relevant window of exposure, and to address specific components of diet in relation to disease.},

Using data on urinary arsenic metabolite concentrations and approximately 300,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 1,313 arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi individuals, we identified genome-wide significant association signals (P{\textless}5×10(-8)) for percentages of both monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) near the AS3MT gene (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32), with five genetic variants showing independent associations. In a follow-up analysis of 1,085 individuals with arsenic-induced premalignant skin lesions (the classical sign of arsenic toxicity) and 1,794 controls, we show that one of these five variants (rs9527) is also associated with skin lesion risk (P = 0.0005). Using a subset of individuals with prospectively measured arsenic (n = 769), we show that rs9527 interacts with arsenic to influence incident skin lesion risk (P = 0.01). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses of genome-wide expression data from 950 individual's lymphocyte RNA suggest that several of our lead SNPs represent cis-eQTLs for AS3MT (P = 10(-12)) and neighboring gene C10orf32 (P = 10(-44)), which are involved in C10orf32-AS3MT read-through transcription. This is the largest and most comprehensive genomic investigation of arsenic metabolism and toxicity to date, the only GWAS of any arsenic-related trait, and the first study to implicate 10q24.32 variants in both arsenic metabolism and arsenical skin lesion risk. The observed patterns of associations suggest that MMA{\%} and DMA{\%} have distinct genetic determinants and support the hypothesis that DMA is the less toxic of these two methylated arsenic species. These results have potential translational implications for the prevention and treatment of arsenic-associated toxicities worldwide.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) might affect child health; but maternal determinants of PFAS exposure are unclear. We evaluated the socio-demographic and dietary factors of prenatal PFAS concentrations in a Spanish birth cohort. Methods: We analyzed perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) in 1216 plasma samples collected during the 1ST trimester of pregnancy (2003-2008). We used multivariable linear regressions to assess the geometric mean (GM) ratios of PFAS concentrations by socio-demographic and dietary factors. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the variability of PFAS concentrations by maternal factors. Results: GM PFAS concentrations ranged from 0.55 ng/mL for PFHxS to 5.77 ng/mL for PFOS. Women born outside of Spain had lower PFAS concentrations (e.g. GM ratio for PFHxS 0.53[95{\%}CI: 0.46, 0.60] than Spanish women. PFHxS and PFOA concentrations were higher in mothers from the regions of Sabadell (2.13[1.93, 2.35] and 1.73[1.60, 1.88], respectively) and Valencia (1.40[1.28, 1.54] and 1.42[1.31, 1.53], respectively) than Gipuzkoa. PFOA and PFNA concentrations decreased with parity (??? 2 children: 0.79[0.67, 0.94] and 0.82[0.68, 0.99], respectively). Younger women (i.e. {\textless} 25 years) had lower PFHxS (0.73[0.62, 0.86]) and PFOS (0.85[0.75, 0.96]) concentrations than older women. PFHxS and PFOA concentrations were lower in women who previously breastfed for {\textgreater} 6 months compared to those who never breastfed (0.79[0.67, 0.94] and 0.82[0.71, 0.95], respectively). High intake of fish and shellfish during pregnancy (i.e. ??? 5.6 servings/week) was associated with 11{\%} (1.11[1.04, 1.18]) higher PFOS concentrations than the lowest intake group. Our ANOVA models explained 26{\%} to 40{\%} of PFAS concentrations variability. Conclusions: Prenatal PFAS concentrations were mainly determined by maternal country of birth, region of residence, previous breastfeeding and age. Fish and shellfish intake also contributed to PFOS and PFOA concentrations.},

The challenge of understanding how these conditions shape patterns of population health in Latin America requires an inter-disciplinary lens. This paper reviews the burden of chronic non-communicable diseases in the region and examines key myths surrounding their prevalence and distribution.

	abstract = {Consumption of rice and rice products can be a significant exposure pathway to inorganic arsenic (iAs), which is a group 1 carcinogen to humans. The UK follows the current European Commission regulations so that iAs concentrations must be {\textless} 0.20 mg kg−1 in white (polished) rice and {\textless}0.25 mg kg−1 in brown (unpolished) rice. However, iAs concentration in rice used for infant food production or direct consumption has been set at a maximum of 0.1 mg kg−1. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate iAs concentrations in different types of rice sold in the UK and to quantify the health risks to the UK population. Here, we evaluated 55 different types of rice purchased from a range of retail outlets. First, we analysed all rice types for total As (tAs) concentration from which 42 rice samples with tAs {\textgreater} 0.1 mg kg−1 were selected for As speciation using HPLC-ICP-MS. Based on the average concentration of iAs of our samples, we calculated values for the Lifetime Cancer Risk (LCR), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ) and Margin of Exposure (MoE). We found a statistically significant difference between organically and non-organically grown rice. We also found that brown rice contained a significantly higher concentration of iAs compared to white or wild rice. Notably, 28 rice samples exceeded the iAs maximum limit stipulated by the EU (0.1 mg kg−1) with an average iAs concentration of 0.13 mg kg−1; therefore consumption of these rice types could be riskier for infants than adults. Based on the MoE, it was found that infants up to 1 year must be restricted to a maximum of 20 g per day for the 28 rice types to avoid carcinogenic risks. We believe that consumers could be better informed whether the marketed product is fit for infants and young children, via appropriate product labelling containing information about iAs concentration. Nearly half of the 55 rice samples marketed in the UK are unfit for infant food purposes, whereas iAs levels pose a minimal health risk to adults.},

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: It seems there is a positive correlation between rice content and arsenic level in foods. This is of extraordinary importance for infants below 1 y of age because their diet is very limited and in some cases is highly dependent on rice-based products; this is particularly true for infants with the celiac disease because they have no other option than consume gluten-free products, such as rice or corn. Arsenic contents were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.001) in gluten-free infant rice (0.057 mg kg⁻¹) than in products with gluten, based on a mixture of cereals (0.024 mg kg⁻¹). Besides, especial precaution must be taken when preparing rice-based products at home, because arsenic content in Spanish rice was high, with levels being above 0.3 mg kg⁻¹ in some cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRACTICAL APPLICATION: From the data presented in this manuscript, it seems imperative that legislation on maximum residues of arsenic in food should be available as soon as possible to protect consumers worldwide. Research is needed to identify or breed rice cultivars with low accumulation of arsenic in the grain; otherwise the rice percentage in infant foods should be reduced.},

	abstract = {Long-term use of arsenic contaminated groundwater to irrigate crops, especially paddy rice (Oryza sativaL.) has resulted in elevated soil arsenic levels in Bangladesh. There is, therefore, concern regarding accumulation of arsenic in rice grown on these soils. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of arsenic-contaminated irrigation water on the growth and uptake of arsenic into rice grain, husk, straw and root. There were altogether 10 treatments which were a combination of five arsenate irrigation water concentrations (08 mg As l-1) and two soil phosphate amendments. Use of arsenate containing irrigation water reduced plant height, decreased rice yield and affected development of root growth. Arsenic concentrations in all plant parts increased with increasing arsenate concentration in irrigation water. However, arsenic concentration in rice grain did not exceed the maximum permissible limit of 1.0 mg As kg-1. Arsenic accumulation in rice straw at very high levels indicates that feeding cattle with such contaminated straw could be a direct threat for their health and also, indirectly, to human health via presumably contaminated bovine meat and milk. Phosphate application neither showed any significant difference in plant growth and development, nor in As concentrations in plant parts.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between urinary levels of As and its metabolites with lung function in children exposed in utero and in early childhood to high As levels through drinking water. A total of 358 healthy children were included in our study. Individual exposure was assessed based on urinary concentration of inorganic As. Lung function was assessed by spirometry. Participants were exposed since pregnancy until early childhood to an average water As concentration of 152.13$\mu$gl-1. The mean urinary As level registered in the studied subjects was 141.2$\mu$gl-1 and only 16.7{\%} had a urinary concentration below the national concern level. Forced vital capacity was significantly decreased in the studied population and it was negatively associated with the percentage of inorganic As. More than 57{\%} of the subjects had a restrictive spirometric pattern. The urinary As level was higher in those children with restrictive lung patterns when compared with the levels registered in subjects with normal spirometric patterns. Exposure to As through drinking water during in utero and early life was associated with a decrease in forced vital capacity and with a restrictive spirometric pattern in the children evaluated.},

In spite of substantial evidence on the association between many illnesses and chronic consumption of As, there is still a considerable uncertainty about the health risks due to low As concentrations in drinking water. In the Netherlands, drinking water companies aim to supply water with As concentration of {\textless}1 $\mu$g/L -- a water quality goal which is tenfold more stringent than the current WHO guideline. This paper provides (i) an account on the assessed lung cancer risk for the Dutch population due to pertinent low-level As in drinking water and cost-comparison between health care provision and As removal from water, (ii) an overview of As occurrence and mobility in drinking water sources and water treatment systems in the Netherlands and (iii) insights into As removal methods that have been employed or under investigation to achieve As reduction to {\textless}1 µg/L at Dutch water treatment plants. Lowering of the average As concentration to {\textless}1$\mu$g/L in the Netherlands is shown to result in an annual benefit of 7.2--14 M€. This study has a global significance for setting drinking water As limits and provision of safe drinking water.},

	abstract = {Objective: Arsenic is a known childhood neurotoxicant, but its neurotoxicity at low exposure levels is still not well established. The aim of our cross-sectional study was to test the association between low-level arsenic exposure and executive functions (EF) among children in Montevideo. We also assessed effect modification by arsenic methylation capacity, a susceptibility factor for the health effects of arsenic, and by B-vitamin intake, which impacts arsenic methylation. Methods: Arsenic exposure was assessed as the specific gravity-adjusted sum of urinary arsenic metabolites (U-As) among 255 {\~{}} 7 year-old children, and methylation capacity as the proportion of urinary monomethylarsonic acid ({\%}MMA). Arsenic concentrations from kitchen water samples at participants' homes were assessed. B-vitamin intake was calculated from the average of two 24-hour dietary recalls. EF was measured using three tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery -- Stockings of Cambridge (SOC), Intra-dimensional/extra-dimensional shift task (IED), and Spatial Span (SSP). Generalized linear models assessed the association between U-As and EF measures; models were adjusted for age, sex, maternal education, possessions score, Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory score, season, and school clusters. Additional analyses were conducted to address issues of residual confounding and sample size. A ``B-vitamin index'' was calculated using principal component analysis. Effect modification by the index and urinary {\%}MMA was assessed in strata split at the respective medians of these variables. Results: The median (range) U-As and water arsenic levels were 9.9 µg/L (2.2, 47.7) and 0.45 µg/L (0.1, 18.9) respectively, indicating that exposure originated mainly from other sources. U-As was inversely associated with the number of stages completed ($\beta$ = −0.02; 95{\%} CI: −0.03, −0.002) and pre-executive shift errors ($\beta$ = −0.08; 95{\%} CI: −0.14, −0.02) of the IED task, and span length of the SSP task ($\beta$ = −0.01; 95{\%} CI: −0.02, −0.004). There was no clear pattern of effect modification by B-vitamin intake or urinary {\%}MMA. Conclusion: Low-level arsenic exposure may adversely affect executive function among children but additional, including longitudinal, studies are necessary to confirm these findings.},

@article{McNamee2005,
	abstract = {Confounding is a major concern in causal studies because it results in biased estimation of exposure effects. In the extreme, this can mean that a causal effect is suggested where none exists, or that a true effect is hidden. Typically, confounding occurs when there are differences between the exposed and unexposed groups in respect of independent risk factors for the disease of interest, for example, age or smoking habit; these independent factors are called confounders. Confounding can be reduced by matching in the study design but this can be difficult and/or wasteful of resources. Another possible approach---assuming data on the confounder(s) have been gathered---is to apply a statistical ``correction'' method during analysis. Such methods produce ``adjusted'' or ``corrected'' estimates of the effect of exposure; in theory, these estimates are no longer biased by the erstwhile confounders. Given the importance of confounding in epidemiology, statistical methods said to remove it deserve scrutiny. Many such methods involve strong assumptions about data relationships and their validity may depend on whether these assumptions are justified. Historically, the most common statistical approach for dealing with confounding in epidemiology was based on stratification; the standardised mortality ratio is a well known statistic using this method to remove confounding by age. Increasingly, this approach is being replaced by methods based on regression models. This article is a simple introduction to the latter methods with the emphasis on showing how they work, their assumptions, and how they compare with other methods. Before applying a statistical correction method, one has to decide which factors are con- founders. This sometimes1--4 complex issue is not discussed in detail and for the most part the examples will assume that age is a confounder. However, the use of automated statistical procedures for choosing variables to include in a regression model is discussed in the context of confounding.},

	abstract = {Fraudulent blending of food products with meat from undeclared species is a problem on a global scale, as exemplified by the European horse meat scandal in 2013. Routinely used methods such as ELISA and PCR can suffer from limited sensitivity or specificity when processed food samples are analyzed. In this study, we have developed an optimized method for the detection of horse and pork in different processed food matrices using MRM and MRM(3) detection of species-specific tryptic marker peptides. Identified marker peptides were sufficiently stable to resist thermal processing of different meat products and thus allow the sensitive and specific detection of pork or horse in processed food down to 0.24{\%} in a beef matrix system. In addition, we were able to establish a rapid 2-min extraction protocol for the efficient protein extraction from processed food using high molar urea and thiourea buffers. Together, we present here the specific and sensitive detection of horse and pork meat in different processed food matrices using MRM-based detection of marker peptides. Notably, prefractionation of proteins using 2D-PAGE or off-gel fractionation is not necessary. The presented method is therefore easily applicable in analytical routine laboratories without dedicated proteomics background.},

Different species (Mytilus galloprovincialis, n=50; Chamelea gallina, n=50; Liza aurata, n=25; Platichthys flesus, n=25; Laminaria digitata, n=15; and Saccharina latissima, n=15) sampled in Tagus estuary, Po delta, Ebro delta, western Scheldt, and in the vicinities of a fish farm area (Solund, Norway), between September and December 2013, were selected to assess metal contamination and potential risks to seafood consumers, as well as to determine the suitability of ecologically distinct organisms as bioindicators in environmental monitoring studies. Species exhibited different elemental profiles, likely as a result of their ecological strategies, metabolism and levels in the environment (i.e. seawater and sediments). Higher levels of Cd (0.15-0.94 mg kg-1), Pb (0.37-0.89 mg kg-1), Co (0.48-1.1 mg kg-1), Cu (4.8-8.4 mg kg-1), Zn (75-153 mg kg-1), Cr (1.0-4.5 mg kg-1) and Fe (283-930 mg kg-1) were detected in bivalve species, particularly in M. galloprovincialis from Ebro and Po deltas, whereas the highest content of Hg was found in P. flesus (0.86 mg kg-1). In fish species, most Hg was organic (MeHg; from 69 to 79{\%}), whereas lower proportions of MeHg were encountered in bivalve species (between 20 and 43{\%}). The highest levels of As were found in macroalgae species L. digitata and S. latissima (41 mg kg-1 and 43 mg kg-1, respectively), with iAs accounting almost 50{\%} of the total As content in L. digitata but not with S. latissima nor in the remaining seafood samples. This work highlights that the selection of the most appropriate bioindicator species is a fundamental step in environmental monitoring of each contaminant, especially in coastal areas. Furthermore, data clearly shows that the current risk assessment and legislation solely based on total As or Hg data is limiting, as elemental speciation greatly varies according to seafood species, thus playing a key role in human exposure assessment via food.},

In vitro research suggests dioxins may bind to the AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) and induce telomerase activity, which elongates LTL. However, few epidemiologic studies have investigated associations between POPs and LTL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: We examined the association between 18 PCBs, 7 dioxins, 9 furans, and LTL among 1,330 US adults from NHANES 2001-2002.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We created 3 summed POP metrics based on toxic equivalency factor (TEF), a potency measure including affinity to the AhR: 1) non-dioxin-like PCBs (comprised of 10 non-dioxin-like PCBs; no AhR affinity and no TEF); 2) non-ortho PCBs (comprised of 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs with high TEF); 3) and toxic equivalency (TEQ) (comprised of 7 dioxins, 9 furans, 2 non-ortho-substituted PCBs, and 6 mono-ortho-substituted PCBs; weighted by TEF). We tested the association between each metric and LTL using linear regression, adjusting for demographics, blood cell count and distribution, and another metric with a different TEF (i.e., non-ortho PCBs and TEQ adjusted for non-dioxin-like PCBs; non-dioxin-like PCBs adjusted for non-ortho PCBs).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In adjusted models, each doubling of serum concentrations of non-ortho PCBs and TEQ was associated with 3.74{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.10, 5.40) and 5.29{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.66, 9.05) longer LTLs, respectively. Compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of exposure was associated with 9.16{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.96, 15.73) and 7.84{\%} (95{\%} CI: -0.53, 16.92) longer LTLs, respectively. Non-dioxin-like PCBs were not associated with LTL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: POPs with high TEFs and AhR affinity were associated with longer LTL. Because many dioxin-associated cancers are also associated with longer LTL, these results may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying PCB and dioxin-related carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental health scientists may find it challenging to fit the structure of the questions addressed in their discipline into the prevailing paradigm for translational research. OBJECTIVE: We aim to frame the translational science paradigm to address the stages of scientific discovery, knowledge acquisition, policy development, and evaluation in a manner relevant to the environmental health sciences. Our intention is to characterize differences between environmental health sciences and clinical medicine, and to orient this effort towards public health goals. DISCUSSION: Translational research is usually understood to have evolved from the bench-to-bedside framework by which basic science transitions to clinical treatment. Although many health-related fields have incorporated the terminology and context of translational science, environmental health research has not always found a clear fit into this paradigm. We describe a translational research framework applicable to environmental health sciences that retains the basic structure that underlies the original bench-to-bedside paradigm. We propose that scientific discovery (T1) in environmental health research frequently occurs through epidemiological or clinical observations. This discovery often involves understanding the potential for human health effects of exposure to a given environmental chemical or chemicals. The practical applications of this discovery evolve through an understanding of exposure--response relationships (T2) and identification of potential interventions to reduce exposure and improve health (T3). These stages of translation require an interdisciplinary partnership between exposure sciences, exposure biology, toxicology, epidemiology, biostatistics, risk assessment, and clinical sciences. Implementation science then plays a crucial role in the development of environmental and public health practice and policy interventions (T4). Outcome evaluation (T5) often takes the form of accountability research, as environmental health scientists work to quantify the costs and benefits of these interventions. CONCLUSION: We propose an easily visualized framework for translation of environmental health science knowledge--from discovery to public health practice--that reflects the crucial interactions between multiple disciplines in our field.},

	abstract = {Arsenic contaminated groundwater is used extensively in Bangladesh to irrigate the staple food of the region, paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.). To determine if this irrigation has led to a buildup of arsenic levels in paddy fields, and the consequences for arsenic exposure through rice ingestion, a survey of arsenic levels in paddy soils and rice grain was undertaken. Survey of paddy soils throughout Bangladesh showed that arsenic levels were elevated in zones where arsenic in groundwater used for irrigation was high, and where these tube-wells have been in operation for the longest period of time. Regression of soil arsenic levels with tube-well age was significant. Arsenic levels reached 46 microg g(-1) dry weight in the most affected zone, compared to levels below l0 microg g(-1) in areas with low levels of arsenic in the groundwater. Arsenic levels in rice grain from an area of Bangladesh with low levels of arsenic in groundwaters and in paddy soils showed that levels were typical of other regions of the world. Modeling determined, even these typical grain arsenic levels contributed considerably to arsenic ingestion when drinking water contained the elevated quantity of 0.1 mg L(-1). Arsenic levels in rice can be further elevated in rice growing on arsenic contaminated soils, potentially greatly increasing arsenic exposure of the Bangladesh population. Rice grain grown in the regions where arsenic is building up in the soil had high arsenic concentrations, with three rice grain samples having levels above 1.7 microg g(-1).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify and evaluate an effective mitigation program for arsenic exposure from drinking water in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effectiveness of a multifaceted mitigation program to reduce As exposure among 11,746 individuals in a prospective cohort study initiated in 2000 in Araihazar, Bangladesh, by interviewing participants and measuring changes in urinary As levels. METHODS: The interventions included a) person-to-person reporting of well test results and health education; b) well labeling and village-level health education; and c) installations of 50 deep, low-As community wells in villages with the highest As exposure. RESULTS: Two years after these interventions, 58{\%} of the 6,512 participants with unsafe wells (As {\textgreater}/=50 microg) at baseline had responded by switching to other wells. Well labeling and village-level health education was positively related to switching to safe wells (As {\textless} 50 mug/L) among participants with unsafe wells [rate ratio (RR) = 1.84; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.60-2.11] and inversely related to any well switching among those with safe wells (RR = 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.66-0.98). The urinary As level in participants who switched to a well identified as safe ({\textless} 50 microg As/L) dropped from an average of 375 microg As/g creatinine to 200 microg As/g creatinine, a 46{\%} reduction toward the average urinary As content of 136 microg As/g creatinine for participants that used safe wells throughout. Urinary As reduction was positively related to educational attainment, body mass index, never-smoking, absence of skin lesions, and time since switching (p for trend {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that testing of wells and informing households of the consequences of As exposure, combined with installation of deep community wells where most needed, can effectively address the continuing public health emergency from arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh.},

Recently, we reported that arsenic exposure during in utero and early life was associated with impairment in the lung function and abnormal receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) sputum levels. Based on our results and the reported arsenic impacts on DNA methylation, we designed this study in our cohort of children exposed in utero and early childhood to arsenic with the aim to associate DNA methylation of MMP9, TIMP1 and RAGE genes with its protein sputum levels and with urinary and toenail arsenic levels. The results disclosed hypermethylation in MMP9 promotor region in the most exposed children; and an increase in the RAGE sputum levels among children with the mid methylation level; there were also positive associations between MMP9 DNA methylation with arsenic toenail concentrations; RAGE DNA methylation with iAs, and {\%}DMA; and finally between TIMP1 DNA methylation with the first arsenic methylation. A negative correlation between MMP9 sputum levels with its DNA methylation was registered. In conclusion, arsenic levels were positive associated with the DNA methylation of extracellular matrix remodeling genes;, which in turn could modifies the biological process in which they are involved causing or predisposing to lung diseases.},

This article presents the results of the 12th proficiency test organised by the EU-RL-HM (IMEP-112) that focused on the determination of total and inorganic arsenic in wheat, vegetable food and algae. The test items used in this exercise were: wheat sampled in a field with a high concentration of arsenic in the soil, spinach (SRM 1570a from NIST) and an algae candidate reference material. Participation in this exercise was open to laboratories from all around the world to be able to judge the state of the art of the determination of total and, more in particular, inorganic arsenic in several food commodities. Seventy-four laboratories from 31 countries registered to the exercise; 30 of them were European National Reference Laboratories. The assigned values for IMEP-112 were provided by a group of seven laboratories expert in the field of arsenic speciation analysis in food. Laboratory results were rated with z and $\zeta$ scores (zeta scores) in accordance with ISO 13528. Around 85 {\%} of the participants performed satisfactorily for inorganic arsenic in vegetable food and 60 {\%} did for inorganic arsenic in wheat, but only 20 {\%} of the laboratories taking part in the exercise were able to report satisfactory results in the algae test material.},

	abstract = {Rice cultivation practices from field preparation to post-harvest transform rice paddies into hot spots for microbial mercury methylation, converting less-toxic inorganic mercury to more-toxic methylmercury, which is likely translocated to rice grain. This review includes 51 studies reporting rice total mercury and/or methylmercury concentrations, based on rice (Orzya sativa) cultivated or purchased in 15 countries. Not surprisingly, both rice total mercury and methylmercury levels were significantly higher in polluted sites compared to non-polluted sites (Wilcoxon rank sum, p{\textless}0.001). However, rice percent methylmercury (of total mercury) did not differ statistically between polluted and non-polluted sites (Wilcoxon rank sum, p=0.35), suggesting comparable mercury methylation rates in paddy soil across these sites and/or similar accumulation of mercury species for these rice cultivars. Studies characterizing the effects of rice cultivation under more aerobic conditions were reviewed to determine the mitigation potential of this practice. Rice management practices utilizing alternating wetting and drying (instead of continuous flooding) caused soil methylmercury levels to spike, resulting in a strong methylmercury pulse after fields were dried and reflooded; however, it is uncertain whether this led to increased translocation of methylmercury from paddy soil to rice grain. Due to the potential health risks, it is advisable to investigate this issue further, and to develop separate water management strategies for mercury polluted and non-polluted sites, in order to minimize methylmercury exposure through rice ingestion. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals(HMs) are defined differently by different people. In health parlance, they are naturally occurring substances that accumulate and cause damage to the environment and living beings, including humans. They also include substances known as semimetals or metalloids that can have the same deleterious effects. Humans are exposed to HMs through inhalation, ingestion, or contact with the skin. Environmental pollution with HMs can result in contamination of air, water, sewage, seawater, waterways, and can accumulate in plants, crops, seafood, and meat and indirectly affect humans. Some occupations have increased risk for particular HMs exposure and toxicity. Some HMs can cause toxicity even at very low concentrations and are known as non-threshold HMs. Factors influencing the risk of toxicity include age, body weight, genetics, route of acquisition, duration of exposure, amount, health, nutritional status, and a combination of HMs. Some preparations used in complementary medicine can result in toxicity. Symptoms and signs of heavy metal(HM) toxicity vary with the substance and can be due to acute exposure to large amounts, or chronic exposure to repeated small quantities which can result in cumulative toxicity. Many body systems can be affected. Toxic exposure to two or more HMs can lead to more damage than a single HM. Investigations include tests of urine, blood, skin, nail, and hair. Management includes preventing any further exposure, removal of the offending agent using chelating agents, supportive therapy, and patient education. Prevention or minimizing exposure is a must, and laws exist to this effect. Public health measures include monitoring air, water, foods, and at-risk individuals, and environmental manipulation of soil, water, and sewage.},

There is intense interest in determining the impact of exposure to environmental chemical mixtures on human health. As the study of mixtures continues to evolve in the field of environmental epidemiology, it is imperative that we understand the methodologic challenges of this research and the types of questions we can address using epidemiological data. In this article, we summarize some of the unique challenges in exposure assessment, statistical methods, and methodology that epidemiologists face in addressing chemical mixtures. We propose three broad questions that epidemiological studies can address: a) What are the potential health impacts of individual chemical agents? b) What is the interaction among agents? And c) what are the health effects of cumulative exposure to multiple agents? As the field of mixtures research grows, we can use these three questions as a basis for defining our research questions and for developing methods that will help us better understand the effect of chemical exposures on human disease and well-being.},

	abstract = {Background: High-chronic arsenic exposure in drinking water is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. At low-chronic levels, as those present in Spain, evidence is scarce. In this ecological study, we evaluated the association of municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations during the period 1998-2002 with cardiovascular mortality in the population of Spain. Methods: Arsenic concentrations in drinking water were available for 1721 municipalities, covering 24.8 million people. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for cardiovascular (361,750 deaths), coronary (113,000 deaths), and cerebrovascular (103,590 deaths) disease were analyzed for the period 1999-2003. Two-level hierarchical Poisson models were used to evaluate the association of municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations with mortality adjusting for social determinants, cardiovascular risk factors, diet, and water characteristics at municipal or provincial level in 651 municipalities (200,376 cardiovascular deaths) with complete covariate information. Results: Mean municipal drinking water arsenic concentrations ranged from {\textless}1 to 118 ??g/L. Compared to the overall Spanish population, sex- and age-adjusted mortality rates for cardiovascular (SMR 1.10), coronary (SMR 1.18), and cerebrovascular (SMR 1.04) disease were increased in municipalities with arsenic concentrations in drinking water {\textgreater}10 ??g/L. Compared to municipalities with arsenic concentrations {\textless}1 ??g/L, fully adjusted cardiovascular mortality rates were increased by 2.2{\%} (-0.9{\%} to 5.5{\%}) and 2.6{\%} (-2.0{\%} to 7.5{\%}) in municipalities with arsenic concentrations between 1-10 and{\textgreater}10 ??g/L, respectively (P-value for trend 0.032). The corresponding figures were 5.2{\%} (0.8{\%} to 9.8{\%}) and 1.5{\%} (-4.5{\%} to 7.9{\%}) for coronary heart disease mortality, and 0.3{\%} (-4.1{\%} to 4.9{\%}) and 1.7{\%} (-4.9{\%} to 8.8{\%}) for cerebrovascular disease mortality. Conclusions: In this ecological study, elevated low-to-moderate arsenic concentrations in drinking water were associated with increased cardiovascular mortality at the municipal level. Prospective cohort studies with individual measures of arsenic exposure, standardized cardiovascular outcomes, and adequate adjustment for confounders are needed to confirm these ecological findings. Our study, however, reinforces the need to implement arsenic remediation treatments in water supply systems above the World Health Organization safety standard of 10 ??g/L. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

We aimed to explore the association of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk with the internal dose of heavy metals by constructing a hospital-based case-control study and using propensity-score-matching methods. We investigated 170 patients with AD and 264 controls from the Department of Neurology and Family Medicine, China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan. All patients with AD received clinical neuropsychological examination and cognitive-function assessments, including the mini-mental status examination and clinical dementia rating scale. We also constructed a propensity-score-matched population of 82 patients with AD and 82 controls by matching age, gender, education, and AD-related comorbidity. Blood levels with cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, and urinary arsenic profile were measured. Logistic regression models and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to estimate AD risk. After stratification by respective quartile cutoffs of heavy metals, the AD risk of study participants with high urinary inorganic arsenic (InAs{\%}) or low dimethylarsinic acid (DMA{\%}) significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.05), as similarly found in the propensity-score-matched population. In addition, people with a low median level of selenium and high median level of InAs{\%}, or/and a low median level of DMA{\%} had approximately two- to threefold significant AD risk. Urinary arsenic profiles may be associated with increased AD risk. Repeat measurements of heavy metals with large sample size and the surveying of potential exposure sources are recommended in future studies.},

There is concern, however, about the long-term effects of the maternal use of high dosages of FASs that exceed the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) (≥1000 $\mu$g/d) on child neurocognitive outcomes.Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association between the use of high dosages of FASs during pregnancy and child neuropsychological development at ages 4-5 y.Design: The multicenter prospective mother-child cohort study, the Infancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Project, was conducted in 4 regions of Spain: Asturias, Sabadell, Gipuzkoa, and Valencia. Pregnant women were recruited between 2003 and 2008. Data on 1682 mother-child pairs were included in the final analyses. The pregnant women completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire that was validated to estimate typical dietary folate intake and the use of FASs at 10-13 and 28-32 wk of gestation. Neuropsychological development scores at 4-5 y of age were estimated with the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Multiple linear regression and meta-analysis were used to obtain combined-effect estimates.Results: During the periconception period, one-third of the women (n = 502) took FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d. The use of FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d in this period was negatively associated with several neuropsychological outcomes scores in children: global verbal ($\beta$ = -2.49; 95{\%} CI: -4.71, -0.27), verbal memory ($\beta$ = -3.59; 95{\%} CI: -6.95, -0.23), cognitive function of posterior cortex ($\beta$ = -2.31; 95{\%} CI: -4.45, -0.18), and cognitive function of left posterior cortex ($\beta$ = -3.26; 95{\%} CI: -5.51, -1.01).Conclusions: The use of FAS dosages exceeding the UL (≥1000 $\mu$g/d) during the periconception period was associated with lower levels of cognitive development in children aged 4-5 y. The use of FAS dosages ≥1000 $\mu$g/d during pregnancy should be monitored and prevented as much as possible, unless medically prescribed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Arsenic exposure has been linked to epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation in in-vitro and animal studies. This association has also been explored in highly exposed human populations, but studies among populations environmentally exposed to low arsenic levels are lacking. METHODS We evaluated the association between exposure to arsenic, measured in toenails, and blood DNA methylation in Alu and Long Interspersed Nucleotide Element-1 (LINE-1) repetitive elements in elderly men environmentally exposed to low levels of arsenic. We also explored potential effect modification by plasma folate, cobalamin (vitamin B12), and pyridoxine (vitamin B6). The study population was 581 participants from the Normative Aging Study in Boston, of whom 434, 140, and 7 had 1, 2, and 3 visits, respectively, between 1999-2002 and 2006-2007. We used mixed-effects models and included interaction terms to assess potential effect modification by nutritional factors. RESULTS There was a trend of increasing Alu and decreasing LINE-1 DNA methylation as arsenic exposure increased. In subjects with plasma folate below the median ({\textless}14.1 ng/mL), arsenic was positively associated with Alu DNA methylation ($\beta$ = 0.08 [95{\%} confidence interval = 0.03 to 0.13] for one interquartile range [0.06 $\mu$g/g] increase in arsenic), whereas a negative association was observed in subjects with plasma folate above the median ($\beta$ = -0.08 [-0.17 to 0.01]). CONCLUSIONS We found an association between arsenic exposure and DNA methylation in Alu repetitive elements that varied by folate level. This suggests a potential role for nutritional factors in arsenic toxicity.},

	abstract = {A large population in Bangladesh have been exposed to naturally occurring inorganic arsenic through their drinking water. A prevalence comparison study of respiratory disorders among subjects with and without arsenic exposure through drinking water was conducted in Bangladesh. Characteristic skin lesions, keratoses and pigmentation alteration, and the water arsenic level confirmed the arsenic exposure. Three villages were selected from health awareness campaign programs. Participants in these courtyard meetings who had suspected skin lesions, i.e., keratosis, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, were examined by a well-trained medical officer to confirm the diagnosis. Unexposed subjects were randomly selected from another village, where tubewells were not contaminated with arsenic. We interviewed and examined 218 individuals irrespective of age and sex from these villages. The arsenic level in their drinking water was measured and the mean arsenic level was 614 $\mu$g/l (ranging from 136 $\mu$g/l to 1,000 $\mu$g/l). Information regarding respiratory system signs and symptoms was also collected. There were few smokers, and analyses were therefore confined to nonsmokers. The overall crude prevalence (or risk) among the exposed subjects for chronic cough, and chronic bronchitis, was three times the prevalence in the control population. Age was a slightly negative confounding factor. The crude prevalence ratios were noticeably increased for female participants compared to male participants. A possible explanation for this noticeably increased occurrence of respiratory signs and symptoms in women is related to the presence of weakness. These results add to the evidence that longterm ingestion of arsenic can cause respiratory problems especially among females.},

	abstract = {Direct or indirect exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the forms of AsIII (arsenite) and AsV (arsenate) through consumption of As-contaminated food materials and drinking water leads to arsenic poisoning. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) plant potentially accumulates a high amount of iAs from paddy fields than any other cereal crops. This makes it to be a major source of iAs especially among the population that uses it as their dominant source of diet. The accumulation of As in human bodies poses a serious global health risk to the human population. Various conventional methods have been applied to reduce the arsenic accumulation in rice plant. However, the success rate of these techniques is low. Therefore, the development of efficient and effective methods aimed at lowering iAs toxicity is a very crucial public concern. With the current advancement in technology, new strategies aimed at addressing this concern are being developed and utilized in various parts of the world. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the management of iAs in rice plants emphasizing the use of nanotechnology and biotechnology approaches. Also, the prospects and challenges facing these approaches are described.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is an established human carcinogen, but the mechanisms through which it contributes to for instance lung cancer development are still unclear. As arsenic is methylated during its metabolism, it may interfere with the DNA methylation process, and is therefore considered to be an epigenetic carcinogen. In the present study, we hypothesize that arsenic is able to induce DNA methylation changes, which lead to changes in specific gene expression, in pathways associated with lung cancer promotion and progression. A549 human adenocarcinoma lung cells were exposed to a low (0.08 µM), intermediate (0.4 µM) and high (2 µM) concentration of sodium arsenite for 1, 2 and 8 weeks. DNA was isolated for whole-genome DNA methylation analyses using NimbleGen 2.1 M deluxe promoter arrays. In addition, RNA was isolated for whole-genome transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix microarrays. Arsenic modulated DNA methylation and expression levels of hundreds of genes in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. By combining whole-genome DNA methylation and gene expression data with possibly involved transcription factors, a large molecular interaction network was created based on transcription factor-target gene pairs, consisting of 216 genes. A tumor protein p53 (TP53) subnetwork was identified, showing the interactions of TP53 with other genes affected by arsenic. Furthermore, multiple other new genes were discovered showing altered DNA methylation and gene expression. In particular, arsenic modulated genes which function as transcription factor, thereby affecting target genes which are known to play a role in lung cancer promotion and progression.},

Data from a case-control study of 792 cases and 792 matched controls conducted in Bangladesh from 2001 to 2003 were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to assess the associations between four common base excision repair (BER) genetic polymorphisms X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) Arg399Gln, XRCC1 Arg194Trp, human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) Ser326Cys and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) Asp148Glu and arsenic-induced skin lesions including melanosis and keratosis. Adjusted for toenail arsenic, body mass index, education, smoking and betel nut use, individuals with the APE1 148Glu/Glu polymorphism had a 2-fold increased odds of skin lesions compared with individuals with the 148Asp/Asp genotype (1.93; 95{\%} confidence interval 1.15, 3.19). Gene-environment interactions between toenail arsenic and XRCC1 Arg194Trp and APE1 Asp148Glu were observed. Within the lowest arsenic tertile, APE1 148Glu/Glu had 2.5 times the odds ratio compared with wild-type, whereas within the highest tertile of arsenic the odds ratios for skin lesions did not differ. In contrast, at low arsenic levels, the odds ratios for skin lesions did not differ much by XRCC1 Arg194Trp genotype. However, at the highest tertile of arsenic, the XRCC1 194Arg/Arg polymorphism conferred a 3-fold larger odds ratio for skin lesions compared with XRCC1 194Trp/Trp. Individuals may have different odds for developing skin lesions based in part on their genetic profile for BER and their arsenic exposure history. Future research on arsenic-induced skin lesions should consider the impact of genetic variation to individual susceptibility to arsenic toxicity.},

In the present meta-analysis, two researchers independently searched electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Springer, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, to analyze factors influencing arsenic methylation. The concentrations of the following arsenic metabolites increase (p{\textless} 0.000001) following arsenic exposure: inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethyl arsenic (MMA), dimethyl arsenic (DMA), and total arsenic. Additionally, the percentages of iAs (standard mean difference (SMD): 1.00; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.40; p{\textless} 0.00001) and MMA (SMD: 0.49; 95{\%} CI: 0.21-0.77; p = 0.0006) also increase, while the percentage of DMA (SMD: -0.57; 95{\%} CI: -0.80--0.31; p{\textless} 0.0001), primary methylation index (SMD: -0.57; 95{\%} CI: -0.94--0.20; p = 0.002), and secondary methylation index (SMD: -0.27; 95{\%} CI: -0.46--0.90; p = 0.004) decrease. Smoking, drinking, and older age can reduce arsenic methylation, and arsenic methylation is more efficient in women than in men. The results of this analysis may provide information regarding the role of arsenic oxidative methylation in the arsenic poisoning process.},

Inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the drinking water is a concern in many regions, such as northern Mexico. Studies in several countries have associated the proportion of urinary monomethylarsenic ({\%}MMA) with increased risks for many As-related diseases, including cancer. To investigate the potential relationships between the risk of BC and the capacity to methylate iAs, a hospital-based case-control study (1016 cases/1028 controls) was performed in northern Mexico. Women were directly interviewed about their reproductive histories. The profile of As metabolites in urine was determined by HPLC-ICP-MS and methylation capacity was assessed by metabolite percentages and indexes. Total urinary As, excluding arsenobetaine (TAs-AsB), ranged from 0.26 to 303.29$\mu$g/L. Most women (86{\%}) had TAs-AsB levels below As biological exposure index (35$\mu$g/L). Women with higher {\%}MMA and/or primary methylation index (PMI) had an increased BC risk ({\%}MMA ORQ5vs.Q1=2.63; 95{\%}CI 1.89,3.66; p for trend {\textless}0.001; PMI ORQ5vs.Q1=1.90; 95{\%}CI 1.39,2.59, p for trend {\textless}0.001). In contrast, women with higher proportion of urinary dimethylarsenic ({\%}DMA) and/or secondary methylation index (SMI) had a reduced BC risk ({\%}DMA ORQ5vs.Q1=0.63; 95{\%}CI 0.45,0.87, p for trend 0.006; SMI ORQ5vsQ1=0.42, 95{\%}CI 0.31,0.59, p for trend {\textless}0.001). Neither {\%}iAs nor total methylation index was associated to BC risk. Inter-individual variations in iAs metabolism may play a role in BC carcinogenesis. Women with higher capacity to methylate iAs to MMA and/or a lower capacity to further methylate MMA to DMA were at higher BC risk.},

Elevated levels of Ni in this population warrant further investigation. Significant differences in the mean concentration of Al, V, Cr, Mn, Cd, Pb, and Se exist between toenails of adults and children. Pearson correlation coefficients reveal strong significant associations among Cd, Cr, and Tl (p{\textless}0.05), in addition to other elements.

	abstract = {Dietary rice consumption can assume a significant pathway of the carcinogenic arsenic (As) in the human system. In search of a viable mitigation strategy, a field experiment was conducted with rice (cv. IET-4786) at geogenically arsenic-contaminated areas (West Bengal, India) for two consecutive years. The research aimed to explore irrigation management (saturation and alternate wetting and drying), and organic amendments (vermicompost, farmyard manure, and mustard cake) efficiencies in reducing As load in the whole soil-plant system. A thrice replicated strip plot design was employed and As content in the soil, plant parts, and the associated soil physicochemical properties were determined through a standard protocol. Results revealed that the most negligible As accumulation in the edible grains was accomplished by vermicompost amendment along with alternate wetting and drying (0.318 mg kg−1) over farmer's practice of continuous submergence with no manure situation (0.895 mg kg−1). Interestingly, an increase in the grain yield by 25{\%} was also observed. The risk of dietary exposure to As through rice was assessed by target cancer risk (TCR) and severity adjusted margin of exposure (SAMOE) mediated risk thermometer. The adopted strategy made all the risk factors somewhat benign to ensure a better standard of health. The Machine Learning algorithm revealed that Random Forest performed better in predicting grain As concentration than k-Nearest Neighbour and Generalized Regression Model. Hence, if properly calibrated and validated, the former can represent an effective tool for predicting grain As concentration in rice.},

This observational science relies upon events occurring within human populations, so-called natural experiments, from which inference is drawn to identify causes of disease. In particular, environmental epidemiology focuses on physical, chemical, and biologic agents in the environment as disease risk factors, often affecting large populations. Here we summarize fundamental principles of environmental epidemiology, including epidemiologic measures and basic epidemiologic study designs. We also address some of the more salient challenges faced by environmental epidemiology, including confounding, bias and exposure misclassification, and random sampling error, or chance, as well as strategies used to address these, such as biomarkers of exposure. We next touch upon strategies for establishing causal relations between environmental agents and disease, using evidence from environmental epidemiology studies. Finally, we discuss the future of environmental epidemiology. Technological advancements, innovations in the biological sciences, data science developments, and the increasingly collaborative nature of the health sciences position environmental epidemiology at the forefront of human disease prevention and public health protection.},

	abstract = {This study investigated factors that may contribute to the presence of arsenic and other heavy metals in apple and grape juices processed with filter AIDS. Different types and grades of filter AIDS were analyzed for arsenic, lead, and cadmium with inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Potential factors affecting the transfer of heavy metals to juices during filtration treatments were evaluated. Effects of washing treatments on removal of heavy metals from filter AIDS were also determined. Results showed that diatomaceous earth (DE) generally contained a higher level of arsenic than perlite, whereas perlite had a higher lead content than DE. Cellulose contained the lowest level of arsenic among the surveyed filter AIDS. All samples of food-grade filter AIDS contained arsenic and lead levels that were below the U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary limits of 10 ppm of total leachable arsenic and lead for food-grade DE filter AIDS. Two samples of arsenic-rich (.3 ppm) food-grade filter AIDS raised the level of arsenic in apple and grape juices during laboratory-scale filtration treatments, whereas three samples of low-arsenic (,1 ppm) food-grade filter AIDS did not affect arsenic levels in filtered juices. Filtration tests with simulated juices (pH 2.9 to 4.1, Brix [8Bx] 8.2 to 18.1, total suspended solids [TSS]  0.1 to 0.5{\%}) showed that pH or sugar content had no effect on arsenic levels of filtered juices, whereas arsenic content of filtered juice was elevated when higher amounts of filter aid were used for filtration. Authentic unfiltered apple juice (pH 3.6, 8Bx 12.9, TSS 0.4{\%}) and grape juice (pH 3.3, 8Bx 16.2, TSS 0.05{\%}) were used to verify results obtained with simulated juices. However, body feed ratio did not affect the arsenic content of filtered authentic juices. Washing treatments were effective at reducing arsenic, but not cadmium or lead, concentrations in a DE filter aid. This study identified ways to reduce the amount of arsenic transferred to juices during filtration.},

	abstract = {Given the potential adverse health effects related to toxic trace metal exposure and insufficient or excessive levels of essential trace metals in pregnant women and their fetuses, the present study characterizes biomarkers of metal and metalloid exposure at repeated time points during pregnancy among women in Puerto Rico. We recruited 1040 pregnant women from prenatal clinics and collected urine, blood, and questionnaire data on demographics, product use, food consumption, and water usage at up to three visits. All samples were analyzed for 16 metal(loid)s: arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (Cs), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), titanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). Urine samples were additionally analyzed for molybdenum (Mo), platinum (Pt), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), and tungsten (W). Mean concentrations of most metal(loid)s were higher among participants compared to the general US female population. We found weak to moderate correlations for inter-matrix comparisons, and moderate to strong correlations between several metal(loid)s measured within each biological matrix. Blood concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, Hg, and Pb were shown to reflect reliable biomarkers of exposure. For other metals, repeated samples are recommended for exposure assessment in epidemiology studies. Predictors of metal(loid) biomarkers included fish and rice consumption (urinary As), fish and canned food (blood Hg), drinking public water (blood Pb), smoking (blood Cd), and iron/folic acid supplement use (urinary Cs, Mo, and Sb). Characterization of metal(loid) biomarker variation over time and between matrices, and identification of important exposure sources, may inform future epidemiology studies and exposure reduction strategies.},

@article{Stanojevic2008,
	abstract = {Rationale: The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reference is currently recommended for interpreting spirometry results, but it is limited by the lack of subjects younger than 8 years and does not continuously model spirometry across all ages. Objectives: By collating pediatric data from other large-population surveys, we have investigated ways of developing reference ranges that more accurately describe the relationship between spirometric lung function and height and age within the pediatric age range, and allow a seamless transition to adulthood. Methods: Data were obtained from four surveys and included 3,598 subjects aged 4-80 years. The original analyses were sex specific and limited to non-Hispanic white subjects. An extension of the LMS (lambda, mu, sigma) method, widely used to construct growth reference charts, was applied. Measurements and Main Results: The extended models have four important advantages over the original NHANES III analysis as follows: (1) they extend the reference data down to 4 years of age, (2) they incorporate the relationship between height and age in a way that is biologically plausible, (3) they provide smoothly changing curves to describe the transition between childhood and adulthood, and (4) they highlight the fact that the range of normal values is highly dependent on age. Conclusions: The modeling technique provides an elegant solution to a complex and longstanding problem. Furthermore, it provides a biologically plausible and statistically robust means of developing continuous reference ranges from early childhood to old age. These dynamic models provide a platform from which future studies can be developed to continue to improve the accuracy of reference data for pulmonary function tests.},

We measured arsenic concentration in spot urine specimens at 8 and 30 weeks of pregnancy. We assessed a subsample of 1,799 infants, born to these mothers, at 7 months of age on two problem-solving tests (PSTs), the motor scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II, and behavior ratings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Arsenic concentrations in maternal urine were high, with a median (interquartile range) of 81 microg/L (37-207 microg/L) at 8 weeks of gestation and of 84 microg/L (42-230 microg/L) at 30 weeks. Arsenic exposure was related to many poor socioeconomic conditions that also correlated with child development measures. Multiple regressions of children's motor and PST scores and behavior ratings, controlling for socioeconomic background variables, age, and sex, showed no significant effect of urinary arsenic concentration on any developmental outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: We detected no significant effect of arsenic exposure during pregnancy on infant development. However, it is possible that other effects are as yet unmeasured or that effects will become apparent at a later age.},

The purpose of this review is to summarize the genotoxic effects of As in the cells as well as to discuss the importance of signaling and repair of arsenic-induced DNA damage. The current knowledge of specific polymorphisms in candidate genes that confer susceptibility to arsenic exposure is also reviewed. We also discuss the perspectives offered by the determination of biological markers of early effect on health, incorporating genetic polymorphisms, with biomarkers for exposure to better evaluate exposure-response clinical relationships as well as to develop novel preventative strategies for arsenic-health effects.},

	abstract = {This study compares the concentrations of total and different species of arsenic (As) in 29 pairs of raw and cooked rice samples collected from households in an area of West Bengal affected by endemic arsenicism. The aim is to investigate the effects of indigenous cooking practice of the rural villagers on As accumulation and speciation in cooked rice. It is found that inorganic As is the predominant species in both raw (93.8{\%}) and cooked rice (88.1{\%}). Cooking of rice with water low in As ({\textless}10$\mu$gL(-1)) significantly decreases the total and inorganic As content in cooked rice compared to raw rice. Arsenic concentration is mainly decreased during boiling of rice grains with excess water. Washing of rice grains with low As water has negligible effect on grain As concentration. The study suggests that rice cooking with low As water by the villagers is a beneficial risk reduction strategy. Despite reductions in As content in cooked rice because of cooking with low As water, the consumption of cooked rice represents a significant health threat (in terms of chronic As toxicity) to the study population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To examine the effect of regular breakfast consumption on weight change and energy intake in people living in high income countries. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Ovid Medline, and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials published between January 1990 and January 2018 investigating the effect of breakfast on weight or energy intake. ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal were also searched in October 2018 to identify any registered yet unpublished or ongoing trials. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials from high income countries in adults comparing breakfast consumption with no breakfast consumption that included a measure of body weight or energy intake. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Random effects meta-analyses of the effect of breakfast consumption on weight and daily energy intake were performed. RESULTS Of 13 included trials, seven examined the effect of eating breakfast on weight change, and 10 examined the effect on energy intake. Meta-analysis of the results found a small difference in weight favouring participants who skipped breakfast (mean difference 0.44 kg, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.07 to 0.82), but there was some inconsistency across trial results (I2=43{\%}). Participants assigned to breakfast had a higher total daily energy intake than those assigned to skip breakfast (mean difference 259.79 kcal/day, 78.87 to 440.71; 1 kcal=4.18 kJ), despite substantial inconsistency across trial results (I2=80{\%}). All of the included trials were at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain and had only short term follow-ups (mean period seven weeks for weight, two weeks for energy intake). As the quality of the included studies was mostly low, the findings should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSION This study suggests that the addition of breakfast might not be a good strategy for weight loss, regardless of established breakfast habit. Caution is needed when recommending breakfast for weight loss in adults, as it could have the opposite effect. Further randomised controlled trials of high quality are needed to examine the role of breakfast eating in the approach to weight management.

@article{Kurzius-Spencer2017,
	abstract = {Exposure to inorganic arsenic (inAs), a potent toxicant, occurs primarily through ingestion of food and water. The efficiency with which it is methylated to mono and dimethyl arsenicals (MMA and DMA) affects toxicity. Folate, vitamins B12 and B6 are required for 1C metabolism, and studies have found that higher levels of these nutrients increase methylation capacity and are associated with protection against adverse health effects from inAs, especially in undernourished populations. Our aim was to determine whether 1C-related nutrients are associated with greater inAs methylation capacity in a general population sample with overall adequate nutrition and low levels of As exposure. Univariate and multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship of dietary and blood nutrients to urinary As methylation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003--2004. Outcome variables were the percent of the sum of inAs and methylated As species (inAs + MMA + DMA) excreted as inAs, MMA, and DMA, and the ratio of MMA:DMA. In univariate models, dietary folate, vitamin B6 and protein intake were associated with lower urinary inAs{\%} and greater DMA{\%} in adults (≥ 18 years), with similar trends in children (6--18). In adjusted models, vitamin B6 intake (p = 0.011) and RBC folate (p = 0.036) were associated with lower inAs{\%}, while dietary vitamin B12 was associated with higher inAs{\%} (p = 0.002) and lower DMA{\%} (p = 0.030). Total plasma homocysteine was associated with higher MMA{\%} (p = 0.004) and lower DMA{\%} (p = 0.003), but not with inAs{\%}; other blood nutrients showed no association with urinary As. Although effect size is small, these findings suggest that 1C nutrients can influence inAs methylation and potentially play an indirect role in reducing toxicity in a general population sample.},

@article{Goumenou2019,
	abstract = {A hazard quotient (HQ) for a single chemical and the hazard index (HI) for a mixture of chemicals were first described as approaches for risk characterisation by the EPA. HQ is defined as the ratio of exposure to an appropriate reference dose such as the ADI. HI is the sum of the HQs of the chemicals in a mixture. HQ and HI have been used to characterise risk after various exposure scenarios. However, both approaches have a significant limitation in the way they are used. The accurate use of HQ or HI requires estimation of aggregate exposure, that is, exposure to a given chemical(s) from all possible relevant sources. In many studies, risk is assessed assuming exposure from a specific source such as, consumption of water or a specific food item, in which chemical(s) concentration(s) have been measured. In this case the classic HQ/HI approach can result in significant underestimation of risk. For this purpose, we developed an alternative approach, named as Source Related HQ (HQs) where HQS is the ratio of the exposure from the specific source of interest to the respected reference values. According to our approach the HQS, before being compared to the reference dose, should be adjusted by a correction factor, in order to simulate aggregated exposure. A correction factor can be calculated based on the permitted exposure contribution from the specific source to the permitted aggregated exposure. Another important limitation specific to the HI approach is the use of chemical specific ADIs that do not correspond to the same critical effect. In this study, we present an analysis based on the individual critical effects, in order to derive the critical effect and an adversity specific Hazard Index (HIA) and risk characterisation for the whole mixture.},

Secondary outcomes included function and serious adverse events. Reviewers used duplicate abstractions, assessed study quality, pooled data by using a random-effects model, examined funnel plots, and explored heterogeneity by using meta-regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SYNTHESIS: Eighty-nine trials involving 12 667 adults met inclusion criteria. Sixty-eight had a sham control, 40 had a follow-up duration greater than 3 months, and 22 used cross-linked forms of hyaluronic acid. Overall, 71 trials (9617 patients) showed that viscosupplementation moderately reduced pain (effect size, -0.37 [95{\%} CI, -0.46 to -0.28]). There was important between-trial heterogeneity and an asymmetrical funnel plot: Trial size, blinded outcome assessment, and publication status were associated with effect size. Five unpublished trials (1149 patients) showed an effect size of -0.03 (CI, -0.14 to 0.09). Eighteen large trials with blinded outcome assessment (5094 patients) showed a clinically irrelevant effect size of -0.11 (CI, -0.18 to -0.04). Six trials (811 patients) showed that viscosupplementation increased, although not statistically significantly, the risk for flare-ups (relative risk, 1.51 [CI, 0.84 to 2.72]). Fourteen trials (3667 patients) showed that viscosupplementation increased the risk for serious adverse events (relative risk, 1.41 [CI, 1.02 to 1.97]).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: Trial quality was generally low. Safety data were often not reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In patients with knee osteoarthritis, viscosupplementation is associated with a small and clinically irrelevant benefit and an increased risk for serious adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Arco Foundation.},

@article{Zhao2010,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is an environmental and food chain contaminant. Excessive accumulation of As, particularly inorganic arsenic (Asi), in rice (Oryza sativa) poses a potential health risk to populations with high rice consumption. Rice is efficient at As accumulation owing to flooded paddy cultivation that leads to arsenite mobilization, and the inadvertent yet efficient uptake of arsenite through the silicon transport pathway. Iron, phosphorus, sulfur, and silicon interact strongly with As during its route from soil to plants. Plants take up arsenate through the phosphate transporters, and arsenite and undissociated methylated As species through the nodulin 26-like intrinsic (NIP) aquaporin channels. Arsenate is readily reduced to arsenite in planta, which is detoxified by complexation with thiol-rich peptides such as phytochelatins and/or vacuolar sequestration. A range of mitigation methods, from agronomic measures and plant breeding to genetic modification, may be employed to reduce As uptake by food crops.

There is almost no function in the human body which is not affected by lead toxicity. Though in countries like US and Canada the use of lead has been controlled up to a certain extent, it is still used vehemently in the developing countries. This is primarily because lead bears unique physical and chemical properties that make it suitable for a large number of applications for which humans have exploited its benefits from historical times and thus it has become a common environmental pollutant. Lead is highly persistent in the environment and because of its continuous use its levels rise in almost every country, posing serious threats. This article reviews the works listed in the literature with recent updates regarding the toxicity of lead. Focus is also on toxic effects of lead on the renal, reproductive and nervous system. Finally the techniques available for treating lead toxicity are presented with some recent updates.},

We also attempted to identify which time period blood-lead concentrations are most predictive of adult outcome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We recruited adults in the Boston area who had participated as newborns and young children in a prospective cohort study that examined the relationship between lead exposure and childhood intellectual function. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). The association between lead concentrations and IQ scores was examined using linear regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Forty-three adults participated in neuropsychological testing. Childhood blood-lead concentration (mean of the blood-lead concentrations at ages 4 and 10 years) had the strongest relationship with Full-Scale IQ ($\beta$ = -1.89 $\pm$ 0.70, p = 0.01). Full-scale IQ was also significantly related to blood-lead concentration at age 6 months ($\beta$ = -1.66 $\pm$ 0.75, p = 0.03), 4 years ($\beta$ = -0.90 $\pm$ 0.41, p = 0.03) and 10 years ($\beta$ = -1.95 $\pm$ 0.80, p = 0.02). Adjusting for maternal IQ altered the significance of the regression coefficient.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that lead exposure in childhood predicts intellectual functioning in young adulthood. Our results also suggest that school-age lead exposure may represent a period of increased susceptibility. Given the small sample size, however, the potentially confounding effects of maternal IQ cannot be excluded and should be evaluated in a larger study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Previous studies have reported associations between prenatal arsenic exposure and increased risk of infant mortality. An increase in infectious diseases has been proposed as the underlying cause of these associations, but there is no epidemiologic research to support the hypothesis. OBJECTIVE We evaluated the association between arsenic exposure in pregnancy and morbidity during infancy. METHODS This prospective population-based cohort study included 1,552 live-born infants of women enrolled during 2002-2004 in Matlab, Bangladesh. Arsenic exposure was assessed by the concentrations of metabolites of inorganic arsenic in maternal urine samples collected at gestational weeks 8 and 30. Information on symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and diarrhea in infants was collected by 7-day recalls at monthly home visits. RESULTS In total, 115,850 person-days of observation were contributed by the infants during a 12-month follow-up period. The estimated risk of LRTI and severe LRTI increased by 69{\%} [adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.69; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.36-2.09)] and 54{\%} (RR = 1.54; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-1.97), respectively, for infants of mothers with urinary arsenic concentrations in the highest quintile (average of arsenic concentrations measured in early and late gestation, 262-977 µg/L) relative to those with exposure in the lowest quintile ({\textless} 39 µg/L). The corresponding figure for diarrhea was 20{\%} (RR = 1.20; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.43). CONCLUSIONS Arsenic exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased morbidity in infectious diseases during infancy. Taken together with the previous evidence of adverse effects on health, the findings strongly emphasize the need to reduce arsenic exposure via drinking water.},

The current study has determined As, cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) levels of betel quids and its components using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The highest concentrations of As were found in slaked lime (4.56mgkg-1) followed by Piper betel leaves (0.406mgkg-1) and flavoured tobacco (zarda) (0.285mgkg-1), with a mean concentrations of As in betel quids of 0.035mgkg-1 (SD 0.02mgkg-1). Mean concentrations of Cd and Pb in ordinary quids were 0.028 (SD 0.07mgkg-1) and 0.423 (SD 1.4mgkg-1), respectively. We estimated that a daily intake of 6 betel quids could contribute 1.2, 1.9 and 8.5{\%} of the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMDTI) for As, Cd and Pb, respectively. Since betel quid chewing is most prevalent among women, our finding raises concern that women chewers - especially pregnant chewers - may be harming their health and that of their unborn babies through increased exposure to a mixture of toxic elements (As, Cd and Pb). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence of allergic diseases in children has increased globally. Early-life exposure to inorganic arsenic has been found to be associated with impaired immune function and decreased lung function in children; however, the results are inconsistent. We aimed to evaluate the effect of prenatal and childhood exposure to inorganic arsenic on allergic diseases in children, through a 15-year follow-up birth cohort study, conducted in central Taiwan. Methods: Children born to women enrolled in the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study (TMICS-pilot) from December 2000 to November 2001 were recruited and followed every 2--3 years until the age of 14 years. Urinary specimens were collected in the pregnant women during the 3rd trimester and the followed children. Diagnoses of allergic diseases were based on physician diagnoses using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire. Urinary arsenic speciation was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography and inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrophotometry. Results: Of the 261 children from 358 mother-infant pairs for this study, those with asthma and allergic rhinitis reported a higher prevalence of maternal allergy (49.47{\%}) than did non-allergic children (29.81{\%}). In the fully adjusted model, levels of maternal urine (iAs + MMA + DMA) greater than the median were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of asthma (OR = 4.28; 95{\%} CI 1.32, 13.85). Levels of urinary (iAs + MMA + DMA) in children higher than the median were associated with an increased risk of allergic rhinitis (OR = 2.26; 95{\%} CI 1.20, 4.26). Conclusion: Prenatal and childhood exposure to inorganic arsenic were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children, respectively. Further large cohort follow-up studies are important to validate the association between inorganic arsenic exposure and allergic diseases in children.},

This study combined trace element profiles in urine and toenail with survey information from 239 farm workers to assess the extent to which the biomarkers provide complementary exposure information. Urinary Mo levels (average=114. $\mu$g/L) were elevated; average urinary values ($\mu$g/L) for all other elements were: V (1.02), Cr (0.55), Mn (2.15), Fe (34.1), Co (0.47), Ni (2.95), Cu (15.0), As (47.8), Se (25.7), Cd (1.09), Ba (22.5), Pb (2.50) and U (0.15). Average toenail concentrations (mg/kg) were: Mn (2.48), Cu (4.43), As (0.26), Se (0.58), Mo (0.07), Cd (0.03), Ba (1.00), Pb (0.51) and U (0.02). No significant association was found between corresponding elements in urine and toenails. Elemental profiles suggest groundwater (with the exception of Mo) and soil-dust-crop exposure pathways cannot account for elemental variations. The main factors moderating trace element contents are related to depuration processes involving participants[U+05F3] trace element body burden prior to work in Qatar, and interactions of trace element metabolic cycles which over-ride the exposure footprint. Toenail and urine need to be carefully validated before reliable use as biomarkers of exposure in general populations for most elements in the study. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The mining and processing of copper in Kilembe, Western Uganda, from 1956 to 1982 left over 15 Mt. of tailings containing cupriferous and cobaltiferous pyrite dumped within a mountain river valley. This pilot study was conducted to assess the nature and extent of risk to local populations from metal contamination arising from those mining activities. We determined trace element concentrations in mine tailings, soils, locally cultivated foods, house dust, drinking water and human biomarkers (toenails) using ICP-MS analysis of acid digested samples. The results showed that tailings, containing higher concentrations of Co, Cu, Ni and As compared with world average crust values had eroded and contaminated local soils. Pollution load indices revealed that 51{\%} of agricultural soils sampled were contaminated with trace elements. Local water supplies were contaminated, with Co concentrations that exceeded Wisconsin (US) thresholds in 25{\%} of domestic water supplies and 40{\%} of Nyamwamba river water samples. Zinc exceeded WHO/FAO thresholds of 99.4 mg kg− 1 in 36{\%} of Amaranthus vegetable samples, Cu exceeded EC thresholds of 20 mg kg− 1 in 19{\%} of Amaranthus while Pb exceeded WHO thresholds of 0.3 mg kg− 1 in 47{\%} of Amaranthus vegetables. In bananas, 20{\%} of samples contained Pb concentrations that exceeded the WHO/FAO recommended threshold of 0.3 mg kg− 1. However, risk assessment of local foods and water, based on hazard quotients (HQ values) revealed no potential health effects. The high external contamination of volunteers' toenails with some elements (even after a washing process) calls into question their use as a biomarker for metal exposure in human populations where feet are frequently exposed to soil dust. Any mitigation of Kilembe mine impacts should be aimed at remediation of agricultural soils, regulating the discharge of underground contaminated water but also containment of tailing erosion.},

	abstract = {As debate rumbles on about how and how much poor statistics is to blame for poor reproducibility, Nature asked influential statisticians to recommend one change to improve science. The common theme? The problem is not our maths, but ourselves. T o use statistics well, researchers must study how scientists analyse and interpret data and then apply that information to prevent cognitive mistakes. In the past couple of decades, many fields have shifted from data sets with a dozen measurements to data sets with millions. Methods that were developed for a world with sparse and hard-to-collect informa-tion have been jury-rigged to handle bigger, more-diverse and more-complex data sets. No wonder the literature is now full of papers that use outdated statistics, misapply statistical tests and misinterpret results. The application of P values to determine whether an analysis is interesting is just one of the most visible of many shortcomings. It's not enough to blame a surfeit of data and a lack of training in analysis (J. T. Leek and R. D. Peng Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 112, 1645--1646; 2015). It's also impractical to say that statistical metrics such as P values should not be used to make decisions. Sometimes a decision (editorial or funding, say) must be made, and clear guidelines are useful. The root problem is that we know very little about how people analyse and process information. An illustrative exception is graphs. Experiments show that people strug-gle to compare angles in pie charts yet breeze through comparative lengths and heights in bar charts (},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methylation of inorganic arsenic (iAs) via one-carbon metabolism is a susceptibility factor for a range of arsenic-related health effects, but there is no data on the importance of arsenic metabolism for effects on child development.

AIM: To elucidate the development of arsenic metabolism in early childhood.

METHODS: We measured iAs, methylarsonic acid (MA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), the metabolites of iAs, in spot urine samples of 2400 children at 18 months of age. The children were born to women participating in a population-based longitudinal study of arsenic effects on pregnancy outcomes and child development, carried out in Matlab, a rural area in Bangladesh with a wide range of arsenic concentrations in drinking water. Arsenic metabolism was evaluated in relation to age, sex, anthropometry, socio-economic status and arsenic exposure.

RESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in child urine (median 34 microg/L, range 2.4-940 microg/L), adjusted to average specific gravity of 1.009 g/mL, were considerably higher than that measured at 3 months of age, but lower than that in maternal urine. Child urine contained on average 12{\%} iAs, 9.4{\%} MA and 78{\%} DMA, which implies a marked change in metabolite pattern since infancy. In particular, there was a marked increase in urinary {\%}MA, which has been associated with increased risk of health effects.

CONCLUSION: The arsenic metabolite pattern in urine of children at 18 months of age in rural Bangladesh indicates a marked decrease in arsenic methylation efficiency during weaning.},

	abstract = {Background Arsenic exposure via drinking water increases the risk of chronic respiratory disease in adults. However, information on pulmonary health effects in children after early life exposure is limited. Methods This population-based cohort study set in rural Matlab, Bangladesh, assessed lung function and respiratory symptoms of 650 children aged 7-17 years. Children with in utero and early life arsenic exposure were compared with children exposed to less than 10 mg/l in utero and throughout childhood. Because most children drank the same water as their mother had drunk during pregnancy, we could not assess only in utero or only childhood exposure. Results Children exposed in utero to more than 500 mg/l of arsenic were more than eight times more likely to report wheezing when not having a cold [odds ratio (OR) ¼ 8.41, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.66-42.6, P {\textless} 0.01] and more than three times more likely to report shortness of breath when walking on level ground (OR ¼ 3.86, 95{\%} CI: 1.09-13.7, P ¼ 0.02) and when walking fast or climbing (OR ¼ 3.19, 95{\%} CI: 1.22-8.32, P {\textless} 0.01]. However, there was little evidence of reduced lung function in either exposure category. Conclusions Children with high in utero and early life arsenic exposure had marked increases in several chronic respiratory symptoms, which could be due to in utero exposure or to early life exposure, or to both. Our findings suggest that arsenic in water has early pulmonary effects and that respiratory symptoms are a better marker of early life arsenic toxicity than changes in lung function measured by spirometry.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic exposure to certain metals plays a role in disease development. Integrating untargeted metabolomics with urinary metallome data may contribute to better understanding the pathophysiology of diseases and complex molecular interactions related to environmental metal exposures. To discover novel associations between urinary metal biomarkers and metabolism networks, we conducted an integrative metallome-metabolome analysis using a panel of urinary metals and untargeted blood metabolomic data from the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS). Methods: The SHFS is a prospective family-based cohort study comprised of American Indian men and women recruited in 2001--2003. This nested case-control analysis of 145 participants of which 50 developed incident diabetes at follow up in 2006--2009, included participants with urinary metal and untargeted metabolomic data. Concentrations of 8 creatinine-adjusted urine metals/metalloids [antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), molybdenum (Mo), selenium (Se), tungsten (W), uranium (U) and zinc (Zn)], and 4 arsenic species [inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonate (MMA), dimethylarsinate (DMA), and arsenobetaine (AsB)] were measured. Global metabolomics was performed on plasma samples using high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. We performed an integrative network analysis using xMWAS and a metabolic pathway analysis using Mummichog. Results: 8,810 metabolic features and 12 metal species were included in the integrative network analysis. Most metal species were associated with distinct subsets of metabolites, forming single-metal-multiple-metabolite clusters (|r|{\textgreater}0.28, p-value {\textless} 0.001). DMA (clustering with W), iAs (clustering with U), together with Mo and Se showed modest interactions through associations with common metabolites. Pathway enrichment analysis of associated metabolites (|r|{\textgreater}0.17, p-value {\textless} 0.1) showed effects in amino acid metabolism (AsB, Sb, Se and U), fatty acid and lipid metabolism (iAs, Mo, W, Sb, Pb, Cd and Zn). In stratified analyses among participants who went on to develop diabetes, iAs and U clustered together through shared metabolites, and both were associated with the phosphatidylinositol phosphate metabolism pathway; metals were also associated with metabolites in energy metabolism (iAs, MMA, DMA, U, W) and xenobiotic degradation and metabolism (DMA, Pb) pathways. Conclusion: In this integrative analysis of multiple metals and untargeted metabolomics, results show common associations with fatty acid, energy and amino acid metabolism pathways. Results for individual metabolite associations differed for different metals, indicating that larger populations will be needed to confirm the metal--metal interactions detected here, such as the strong interaction of uranium and inorganic arsenic. Understanding the biochemical networks underlying metabolic homeostasis and their association with exposure to multiple metals may help identify novel biomarkers, pathways of disease, potential signatures of environmental metal exposure.},

Arsenic may act on QT by increasing cardiac calcium currents. The authors hypothesized that low-level arsenic exposure would be associated with QT duration and that this effect would be stronger among persons not using calcium channel blockers. They performed a cross-sectional analysis in elderly men from the Normative Aging Study to analyze associations between toenail arsenic and QT and heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) durations and to examine effect modification by calcium channel blocker use, using linear regression and adjusting for potential confounders. Participants were examined in Boston, Massachusetts, between 2000 and 2002 or in 2006. An interquartile range increase in arsenic concentration was associated with a 3.8-millisecond increase in QT (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.82, 6.8) and a 2.5-millisecond increase in QTc (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.11, 4.9). There was no evidence of effect modification by medication use for either QT (P = 0.93) or QTc (P = 0.58). The authors observed positive associations between a biomarker of arsenic exposure and QT duration but found no evidence of effect modification by calcium channel blocker use, possibly because of modest power.},

@article{Hall2006,
	abstract = {Exposure to arsenic (As)-contaminated drinking water affects millions of people worldwide. Arsenic exposure is associated with skin lesions, skin, lung, kidney and liver cancers, neurologic and cardiovascular effects. Past studies involving biomarkers of As exposure have typically examined urinary As (UAs) (adjusted for urinary creatinine), hair or toenail As, but not blood As (BAs) since blood concentrations are exceedingly low and are not detectable by conventional atomic absorption spectrophotometric techniques. In a case-cohort analysis of 303 newly diagnosed cases of skin lesions, and 849 subcohort members randomly selected from 8092 participants in the health effects of as longitudinal study (HEALS) in Araihazar, Bangladesh, we measured blood, urine and water As concentrations, and examined their associations with each other, and with the risk for skin lesions. BAs concentrations were highly correlated with creatinine-adjusted UAs concentrations (r = 0.85) and with water As (WAs) (r = 0.75). We observed consistent dose-response relationships between the risk of skin lesions and all the measures of As exposure. Rate ratios (RRs) for skin lesions by quintile of As exposure, adjusted for age and gender, revealed that the two highest quintiles were significantly related to an increased risk of skin lesions for each measure of exposure: BAs, UAs, WAs and a time-weighted water As variable. This prospective study confirms the increased risk of skin lesions in relation to As concentrations in blood, urine and water and also establishes that BAs is a useful biomarker of As exposure in this study population. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {Arsenic (As), particularly of its inorganic form (iAs) is highly toxic, and its presence in food composites is a matter of concern for the public health safety, specifically in Bangladesh which is regarded as the most arsenic affected country throughout the world. This study was carried out to investigate the levels of As in the composite samples of commonly consumed foodstuffs collected from 30 different agro-ecological zones for the first time in Bangladesh. Most of the individual food composites contain a considerable amount of As which was, as a whole, in the range of 0.077--1.5mg/kg fw which was lower than those reported from Spain, EU, France, Korea, whereas higher than those of Mexico, Chile, Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Serbia, respectively. Cereals, vegetables, milk, and fish contribute about 90{\%} to the daily intake of inorganic arsenic. Human health risk of dietary iAs was assessed separately for both the rural and urban adults. The estimated daily dietary intakes (EDI) of iAs for the exposed rural (3.5) and urban residents (3.2$\mu$g/kg-BW/day) clearly exceeded the previous provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) value of 2.1$\mu$g/kg-BW/day, recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). From the health point of view, this study concluded that both the rural and urban residents of Bangladesh are exposed to carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks who consume As-contaminated water and foodstuffs.},

The impact of factors determined in childhood on adult lung function, decline in lung function and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was investigated. Methods: European Community Respiratory Health Survey participants aged 20-45 years randomly selected from general populations in 29 centres underwent spirometry in 1991-3 (n=13 359) and 9 years later (n=7738). Associations of early life factors with adult forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 decline and COPD (FEV1/FVC ratio {\textless}70{\%} and FEV1 {\textless}80{\%} predicted) were analysed with generalised estimating equation models and random effects linear models. Results: Maternal asthma, paternal asthma, childhood asthma, maternal smoking and childhood respiratory infections were significantly associated with lower FEV1 and defined as "childhood disadvantage factors"; 40{\%} had one or more childhood disadvantage factors which were associated with lower FEV1 (men: adjusted difference 95 ml (95{\%} CI 67 to 124); women: adjusted difference 60 ml (95{\%} CI 40 to 80)). FEV1 decreased with increasing number of childhood disadvantage factors (≥3 factors, men: 274 ml (95{\%} CI 154 to 395), women: 208 ml (95{\%} CI 124 to 292)). Childhood disadvantage was associated with a larger FEV1 decline (1 factor: 2.0 ml (95{\%} CI 0.4 to 3.6) per year; 2 factors: 3.8 ml (95{\%} CI 1.0 to 6.6); ≥3 factors: 2.2 ml (95{\%} CI -4.8 to 9.2)). COPD increased with increasing childhood disadvantage (1 factor, men: OR 1.7 (95{\%} CI 1.1 to 2.6), women: OR 1.6 (95{\%} CI 1.01 to 2.6); ≥3 factors, men: OR 6.3 (95{\%} CI 2.4 to 17), women: OR 7.2 (95{\%} CI 2.8 to 19)). These findings were consistent between centres and when subjects with asthma were excluded. Conclusions: People with early life disadvantage have permanently lower lung function, no catch-up with age but a slightly larger decline in lung function and a substantially increased COPD risk. The impact of childhood disadvantage was as large as that of heavy smoking. Increased focus on the early life environment may contribute to the prevention of COPD.},

	abstract = {Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for iron. These include Average Requirement (AR) and Population Reference Intake (PRI). For adults, whole-body iron losses were modelled using data from US adults. Predicted absorption values, at a serum ferritin concentration of 30 µg/L, of 16 {\%} for men and 18 {\%} for women were used to convert physiological requirements to dietary iron intakes. In men, median whole-body iron losses are 0.95 mg/day, and the AR is 6 mg/day. The PRI, calculated as the dietary requirement at the 97.5th percentile, is 11 mg/day. For postmenopausal women, the same DRVs as for men are proposed. In premenopausal women, additional iron is lost through menstruation but, because losses are highly skewed, the Panel set a PRI of 16 mg/day to cover requirements of 95 {\%} of the population. In infants and children, requirements were calculated factorially, taking into consideration the needs for growth, replacement of losses and percentage iron absorption from the diet (10 {\%} up to 11 years and 16 {\%} thereafter). PRIs were estimated using a coefficient of variation of 20 {\%}. They are 11 mg/day in infants (7--11 months), 7 mg/day in children aged 1--6 years and 11 mg/day in children aged 7--11 years and boys aged 12--17 years. For girls aged 12--17 years, the PRI of 13 mg/day is the midpoint of the calculated dietary requirement of 97.5 {\%} of girls and the PRI for premenopausal women; this approach allows for the large uncertainties in the rate and timing of pubertal growth and menarche. For pregnant and lactating women, for whom it was assumed that iron stores and enhanced absorption provide sufficient additional iron, DRVs are the same as for premenopausal women.},

Two-phase separation began to occur at about 0.32 of I2 molar fraction and over. The separation characteristic became better with the increase in iodine concentration in the solution. The effect of flow rate variations of HI solution and I2 solution from the HIx distillation column on the process was evaluated. The flow rate increase in HI solution from the distillation column did not have a large effect on the flow rate of HI solution fed to the distillation column from the separator. The decreasing flow rate of I2 solution from the distillation column decreased the flow rate of I2 solution fed to the distillation column from the separator. The variation of I2 molar fraction in the H2SO4 phase in the separator was sensitive to the variation in flow rate of both solutions from the distillation column. The tolerance level of the variation was investigated by considering I2 solubility, 2-liquid phase disappearance and SO2 reaction amount.},

Although prior documents have offered guidance on the reporting of test data, there is considerable variability in how these results are presented to end users, leading to potential confusion and miscommunication. Methods: A project task force, consisting of the committee as a whole, was approved to develop a new Technical Standard on reporting pulmonary function test results. Three working groups addressed the presentation format, the reference data supporting interpretation of results, and a system for grading quality of test efforts. Each group reviewed relevant literature and wrote drafts that were merged into the final document. Results: This document presents a reporting format in test-specific units for spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusing capacity that can be assembled into a report appropriate for a laboratory's practice. Recommended reference sources are updated with data for spirometry and diffusing capacity published since prior documents. A grading system is presented to encourage uniformity in the important function of test quality assessment. Conclusions: The committee believes that wide adoption of these formats and their underlying principles by equipment manufacturers and pulmonary function laboratories can improve the interpretation, communication, and understanding of test results.},

Arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism were associated with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. For each interquartile range (IQR) increase in ƩAs (12.5 $\mu$g/L, overall range 0.7-194.1 $\mu$g/L), the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 1.28 (95{\%} CI 1.16-1.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.28 (1.08-1.52) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.15 (0.92-1.44) for cancer mortality. The aHR for mortality for each IQR increase in MMA{\%}, when iAs{\%} is decreasing, was 1.52 (95{\%} CI 1.16-1.99) for cardiovascular disease, 0.73 (0.55-0.98) for cancer, and 1.03 (0.90-1.19) for all-cause mortality. These findings at low-moderate levels of arsenic exposure highlight the need to implement public health measures to protect populations from involuntary arsenic exposure and for research to advance the biological and clinical understanding of arsenic-related health effects in general populations.},

	abstract = {Pregnancy is a period when the mother and her offspring are susceptible to the toxic effects of metals. We investigated associations of intake of frequently consumed foods with urinary metals concentrations among pregnant women in the Pacific Northwest. We measured urinary cadmium (U-Cd), arsenic (U-As) and molybdenum (U-Mo) concentrations from spot urine samples in early pregnancy (15 weeks of gestation, on average) among 558 women from Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. We assessed periconceptional dietary intake using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We also determined early pregnancy zinc concentrations in serum. Statistical analyses involved multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for smoking status, age, race/ethnicity, multivitamin and supplement use, education, estimated total energy intake, and gravidity. The geometric mean and range in $\mu$g/g creatinine for U-Cd, U-As and U-Mo were 0.29 (0.1--8.2), 18.95 (3--550), and 72.1 (15--467), respectively. U-Cd was positively associated with dietary zinc intake (P-value = 0.004) and serum zinc (P-value{\textless}0.001) while it was negatively associated with coffee intake (P-value = 0.03). U-As was positively associated with dietary fish [(Lean fish, fatty fish, shellfish and non-fried fish) (P-values{\textless}0.01)], selenium (P-value = 0.004), zinc (P-value = 0.017), vegetables (P-value = 0.004), and low-fat yogurt (P-value = 0.03). Women who reported higher intake of dietary magnesium (Mg)(P-value = 0.04), insoluble fiber (P-value = 0.03), and low-fat yogurt (P-value = 0.04) had higher U-Mo concentrations. Our study suggests that vegetables, fish, fiber and yogurt might be significant dietary sources of metals. Future studies aimed at investigating the risk of exposure to metals from other various food sources among reproductive-age and pregnant women are needed. Apart from fish intake, dietary sources of metals among pregnant women in the Pacific Northwest might include vegetables, dietary magnesium and zinc, fiber and yogurt.},

	abstract = {The importance or otherwise of rice as an exposure pathway for As ingestion by people living in Bengal and other areas impacted by hazardous As-bearing groundwaters is currently a matter of some debate. Here this issue is addressed by determining the overall increased cancer risk due to ingestion of rice in an As-impacted district of West Bengal. Human target cancer health risks have been estimated through the intake of As-bearing rice by using combined field, laboratory and computational methods. Monte Carlo simulations were run following fitting of model probability curves to measured distributions of (i) As concentration in rice and drinking water and (ii) inorganic As content of rice and fitting distributions to published data on (i) ingestion rates and (ii) body weight and point estimates on bioconcentration factors, exposure duration and other input variables. The distribution of As in drinking water was found to be substantially lower than that reported by previous authors for As in tube wells in the same area, indicating that the use of tube well water as a proxy for drinking water is likely to result in human health risks being somewhat overestimated. The calculated median increased lifetime cancer risk due to cooked rice intake was 7.62 ?? 10-4, higher than the 10-4-10-6 range typically used by the USEPA as a threshold to guide determination of regulatory values and similar to the equivalent risk from water intake. The median total risk from combined rice and water intake was 1.48 ?? 10-3. The contributions to this median risk from drinking water, rice and cooking of rice were found to be 48{\%}, 44{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively. Thus, rice is a major potential source of As exposure in the As-affected study areas in West Bengal and the most important exposure pathway for groups exposed to low or no As in drinking water. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Metal exposure has been associated with a wide range of adverse birth outcomes and oxidative stress is a leading hypothesis of the mechanism of action of metal toxicity. We assessed the relationship between maternal exposure to essential and non-essential metals and metalloids in pregnancy and oxidative stress markers, and sought to identify windows of vulnerability and effect modification by fetal sex. In our analysis of 215 women from the PROTECT birth cohort study, we measured 14 essential and non-essential metals in urine samples at three time points during pregnancy. The oxidative stress marker 8-iso-prostaglandin F2$\alpha$ (8-iso-PGF2$\alpha$) and its metabolite 2,3-dinor-5,6-dihydro-15-15-F2t-IsoP, as well as prostaglandin F2$\alpha$ (PGF2$\alpha$), were also measured in the same urine samples. Using linear mixed models, we examined the main effects of metals on markers of oxidative stress as well as the visit-specific and fetal sex-specific effects. After adjustment for covariates, we found that a few urinary metal concentrations, most notably cesium (Cs) and copper (Cu), were associated with higher 8-iso-PGF2$\alpha$ with effect estimates ranging from 7.3 to 14.9{\%} for each interquartile range, increase in the metal concentration. The effect estimates were generally in the same direction at the three visits and a few were significant only among women carrying a male fetus. Our data show that higher urinary metal concentrations were associated with elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress. Our results also indicate a potential vulnerability of women carrying a male fetus.},

	abstract = {Compliance with 24-h urine samples can be low in population-based studies and first morning void urine samples are often collected for convenience. Interpretation of arsenic concentrations in urine is influenced by a range of factors unrelated to exposure. To reduce the influence of such factors, creatinine adjustment is routinely used. This study aimed to determine whether first morning void urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations approximate 24-h urinary arsenic concentrations and whether creatinine adjustment improved the correlation between environmental arsenic concentrations and urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations. One hundred sixty spot samples and corresponding 24-h urine samples were collected from people living in areas with a range of environmental arsenic concentrations and analyzed for inorganic arsenic using borohydride arsine generation followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There were no significant differences between the urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations for the different sample types or whether creatinine adjusted or not. Significant correlations were observed between adjusted and unadjusted samples. The data set was highly skewed and when only detectable arsenic samples were considered, the relationship between sample types became nonsignificant. The results of this study suggest that spot samples may be adequate for measuring short-term exposure, using inorganic arsenic as the outcome variable; however, additional work on a larger data set is required. Creatinine adjustment of urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations may not be required in population studies investigating environmental exposure.},

	abstract = {Adulteration is a growing food safety concern worldwide. Previous studies have implicated turmeric as a source of lead (Pb) exposure due to the addition of lead chromate (PbCrO4), a yellow pigment used to enhance brightness. We aimed to assess the practice of adding yellow pigments to turmeric and producer- consumer- and regulatory-factors affecting this practice across the supply chain in Bangladesh. We identified and visited the nine major turmeric-producing districts of Bangladesh as well as two districts with minimal turmeric production. In each district, we conducted semi-structured interviews and informal observations with individuals involved in the production, consumption, and regulation of turmeric. We explored perceptions of and preferences for turmeric quality. We collected samples of yellow pigments and turmeric from the most-frequented wholesale and retail markets. We collected samples of turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil from turmeric polishing mills to assess evidence of adulteration. Interviews were analyzed through an inductive, thematic coding process, with attention focused on perceptions of and preferences for turmeric quality. Samples were analyzed for Pb and chromium (Cr) concentrations via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and x-ray fluorescence. In total, we interviewed 152 individuals from across the supply chain and collected 524 samples of turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil (Table S3, Table S4). Turmeric Pb and Cr concentrations were highest in Dhaka and Munshiganj districts, with maximum turmeric powder Pb concentrations of 1152 $\mu$g/g, compared to 690 $\mu$g/g in the 9 major turmeric-producing districts. We found evidence of PbCrO4-based yellow pigment adulteration in 7 of the 9 major turmeric-producing districts. Soil samples from polishing mills contained a maximum of 4257 $\mu$g/g Pb and yellow pigments contained 2--10{\%} Pb by weight with an average Pb:Cr molar ratio of 1.3. Turmeric wholesalers reported that the practice of adding yellow pigments to dried turmeric root during polishing began more than 30 years ago and continues today, primarily driven by consumer preferences for colorful yellow curries. Farmers stated that merchants are able to sell otherwise poor-quality roots and increase their profits by asking polishers to adulterate with yellow pigments. Adulterating turmeric with lead chromate poses significant risks to human health and development. The results from this study indicate that PbCrO4 is being added to turmeric by polishers, who are unaware of its neurotoxic effects, in order to satisfy wholesalers who are driven by consumer demand for yellow roots. We recommend immediate intervention that engages turmeric producers and consumers to address this public health crisis and ensure a future with Pb-free turmeric.},

In a sample of 170 mother-infant pairs from New Hampshire, we determined infant exposure to in utero arsenic by evaluating infant toenails as a biomarker using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Infant toenail arsenic concentration correlated with maternal postpartum toenail concentrations (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.34). In adjusted linear models, a doubling of maternal toenail arsenic concentration was associated with a 53.8{\%} increase in infant toenail arsenic concentration as compared with 20.4{\%} for a doubling of maternal urine arsenic concentration. In a structural equation model, a doubling of the latent variable integrating maternal toenail and urine arsenic concentrations was associated with a 67.5{\%} increase in infant toenail arsenic concentration. A similar correlation between infant and maternal postpartum toenail concentrations was observed in a validation cohort of 130 mother-infant pairs from Rhode Island. In utero exposure to arsenic occurs through maternal water and dietary sources, and infant toenails appear to be a reliable biomarker for estimating arsenic exposure during the critical window of gestation.},

	abstract = {Globally, the risk of arsenic (As) contamination in soil and rice is well documented across the globe. In Bangladesh, drinking water and rice are two major exposure pathways of As to humans. Therefore, the efficiency of recent technologies to reduce rice As and associated human health risks still need to be deeply investigated. In this direction, a pot experiment was performed to investigate the impact of soil As and agronomic irrigation management on rice (cv. BRRI dhan28) growth, yield, As accumulation, and finally, health risks to humans from consuming rice. Treatment combinations were made with three levels of As (0, 20, and 40 mgkg−1) having two irrigation procedures, including alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and traditional continuous flooding (CF). Ac-cording to the findings, As pollution in the soil lowered the yield contributing features and rice yield, including panicle length, filled grains per panicle, sterile grains per panicle, 1000-grain weight, grain yield, and straw yield. AWD water management significantly improved the growth performance and productivity of rice. Grain yield was increased by 13{\%} in AWD compared to CF. Rice grain and straw As concentrations were increased to 0.56 mg kg−1 and 15.10 mg kg−1, respectively, in soil with 40 mg kg−1 As and CF water management. AWD treatment significantly reduced grain and straw As contents by 16{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively. Increased grain, straw, and total As uptake was noticed with higher soil As concentrations. The study also found that rising soil As raised non-carcinogenic risks (HQ {\textgreater} 1) and carcinogenic risks (CR {\textgreater} 1.010--4) while AWD lowered health risks compared to CF. Thus, rice farming using AWD irrigation could be a viable and long-term solution for reducing As contamination in rice and associated human health hazards.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE. We investigated the effects of head growth prenatally, during infancy, and during later periods of development on cognitive function at the ages of 4 and 8 years.

METHODS. We studied 633 term-born children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort whose head circumference was measured at birth and at regular intervals thereafter. Their cognitive function was assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at the age of 4 years and with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at the age of 8 years. Linear regression analysis was used to calculate postnatal head growth between successive time points, conditional on previous size, and to examine the relationship between head growth during different periods of development and later IQ.

RESULTS. When the influence of head growth was distinguished for different periods, only prenatal growth and growth during infancy were associated with subsequent IQ. At 4 years, after adjustment for parental characteristics, full-scale IQ increased an average of 2.41 points for each 1-SD increase in head circumference at birth and 1.97 points for each 1-SD increase in head growth during infancy, conditional on head size at birth. At 8 years, head circumference at birth was no longer associated with IQ, but head growth during infancy remained a significant predictor, with full-scale IQ increasing an average of 1.56 points for each 1-SD increase in growth.

CONCLUSION. The brain volume a child achieves by the age of 1 year helps determine later intelligence. Growth in brain volume after infancy may not compensate for poorer earlier growth.},

	abstract = {Background In 2003 the INMA---INfancia y Medio Ambiente (Environment and Childhood) project, a Spanish national network of birth cohorts including more than 3500 participants, was set up with the aim to assess the health impacts of pre- and postnatal environmental exposures on children. The project has published more than 60 papers on maternal and environmental factors related to neuropsychological development in children, one of the main research interests within the project. With the present review, we evaluate the evidence provided by the INMA project on this topic and discuss how the data can contribute to cover the challenges that children's environmental health research will face in the coming years. Results The INMA project has contributed to provide increasing evidence of the association between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and child neuropsychological development, but it has also shown, using innovative methodologies, that postnatal exposure to these compounds does not play a role in this association. The project has also contributed to show the detrimental influence of certain air pollutants on child neuropsychological development, as well as how a balanced maternal fish intake can protect from the potential adverse effects of prenatal exposure to mercury. Also, the project has contributed to the understanding of impacts of nutritional factors including supplement intake and vitamin D levels during pregnancy and the role of breastfeeding on the neuropsychological benefits. Conclusions INMA findings underscore the importance of continued research on the delineation of the sensitive windows of exposure both during pregnancy and postnatally and on the combined effects of environmental exposures, denoted the exposome. In terms of health policy, INMA findings have important implications for the development of public health policies to advance the health and development of children.},

	abstract = {Background/objectives: A higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet has been shown to be protective against obesity in adults, but the evidence is still inconclusive in children at early ages. Our objective was to explore the association between adherence to Mediterranean Diet at the age of 4 and the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity at 4 years of age, and incidence at the age of 8. Subjects/methods: We analyzed data from children of the INMA cohort study who attended follow-up visits at age 4 and 8 years (n = 1801 and n = 1527, respectively). Diet was assessed at the age of 4 using a validated food frequency questionnaire. The adherence to MD was evaluated by the relative Mediterranean diet (rMED) score, and categorized as low (0--6), medium (7--10), and high (11--16). Overweight and obesity were defined according to the age-sex specific BMI cutoffs proposed by the International Obesity Task Force, and abdominal obesity as waist circumference {\textgreater}90th percentile. We used Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios at 4 years of age, and Cox regression analysis to estimate hazard ratios (HR) from 4--8 years of age. Results: In cross-sectional analyses at the age of 4 no association was observed between adherence to MD and overweight, obesity, or abdominal obesity. In longitudinal analyses, a high adherence to MD at age 4 was associated with lower incidence of overweight (HR = 0.38; 95{\%} CI: 0.21--0.67; p = 0.001), obesity (HR = 0.16; 95{\%} CI: 0.05--0.53; p = 0.002), and abdominal obesity (HR = 0.30; 95{\%} CI: 0.12--0.73; p = 0.008) at the age of 8. Conclusion: This study shows that a high adherence to MD at the age of 4 is associated with a lower risk of developing overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity at age 8. If these results are confirmed by other studies, MD may be recommended to reduce the incidence of obesity at early ages.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Few studies have investigated the role of exposure to metals and metal mixtures on oxidative stress in the general population. Objectives: We evaluated the cross-sectional association of urinary metal and metal mixtures with urinary oxidative stress biomarkers, including oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8‑oxo‑7,8‑dihydroguanine (8-oxo-dG), in a representative sample of a general population from Spain (Hortega Study). Methods: Urine antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn) were measured by ICPMS in 1440 Hortega Study participants. Results: The geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of GSSG/GSH comparing the 80th to the 20th percentiles of metal distributions were 1.15 (95{\%} confidence intervals [95{\%} CI]: 1.03--1.27) for Mo, 1.17 (1.05--1.31) for Ba, 1.23 (1.04--1.46) for Cr and 1.18 (1.00--1.40) for V. For MDA, the corresponding GMRs (95{\%} CI) were 1.13 (1.03--1.24) for Zn and 1.12 (1.02--1.23) for Cd. In 8-oxo-dG models, the corresponding GMR (95{\%} CI) were 1.12 (1.01--1.23) for Zn and 1.09 (0.99--1.20) for Cd. Cr for GSSG/GSH and Zn for MDA and 8-oxo-dG drove most of the observed associations. Principal component (PC) 1 (largely reflecting non-essential metals) was positively associated with GSSG/GSH. The association of PC2 (largely reflecting essential metals) was positive for GSSG/GSH but inverse for MDA. Conclusions: Urine Ba, Cd, Cr, Mo, V and Zn were positively associated with oxidative stress measures at metal exposure levels relevant for the general population. The potential health consequences of environmental, including nutritional, exposure to these metals warrants further investigation.},

On the other hand, the accelerated failure time model, which simply regresses the logarithm of the survival time over the covariates, has seldom been utilized in the analysis of censored survival data. In this article, we review some newly developed linear regression methods for analysing failure time observations. These procedures have sound theoretical justification and can be implemented with an efficient numerical method. The accelerated failure time model has an intuitive physical interpretation and would be a useful alternative to the Cox model in survival analysis.

	abstract = {Accumulating evidence favours the view that increased intake of dietary fibre in an otherwise low-fibre diet can have beneficial effects in both human and experimental animals. These benefits include prevention or alleviation of maladies such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diverticulosis and colon cancer. Studies have repeatedly shown that rice bran gives interesting health benefits. Compositional analysis reveals that rice bran consists of almost 27{\%} dietary fibre and has been reported to have positive effects, such as laxative and cholesterol-lowering ability. This suggests that rice bran is a good fibre source that can be added to various food products. This paper examines the use of a dietary fibre preparation, derived from defatted rice bran, as a functional ingredient added to bakery products. The results show that dietary fibre from defatted rice bran has comparable water-binding capacity to FIBREX, commercial fibre from sugar beet. Dietary fibre from rice bran exhibited higher fat binding and emulsifying capacity compared to FIBREX. However, rice bran fibre was found to be less viscous than FIBREX. Addition of 5 and 10{\%} dietary fibre preparation reduced loaf volume significantly and increased the firmness of the breads. Sensory evaluations revealed that breads with 5 and 10{\%} rice bran fibre were comparable to high-fibre bread available in the market. This confirms that the dietary fibre preparation from defatted rice bran has great potential in food applications, especially in development of functional foods.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic is a human lung carcinogen. We studied the ability of chronic inorganic arsenic (2. $\mu$M; as sodium arsenite) exposure to induce a cancer phenotype in the immortalized, non-tumorigenic human lung peripheral epithelial cell line, HPL-1D. After 38. weeks of continuous arsenic exposure, secreted matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) activity increased to over 200{\%} of control, levels linked to arsenic-induced cancer phenotypes in other cell lines. The invasive capacity of these chronic arsenic-treated lung epithelial (CATLE) cells increased to 320{\%} of control and colony formation increased to 280{\%} of control. CATLE cells showed enhanced proliferation in serum-free media indicative of autonomous growth. Compared to control cells, CATLE cells showed reduced protein expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (decreased to 26{\%} of control) and the putative tumor suppressor gene SLC38A3 (14{\%} of control). Morphological evidence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurred in CATLE cells together with appropriate changes in expression of the EMT markers vimentin (VIM; increased to 300{\%} of control) and e-cadherin (CDH1; decreased to 16{\%} of control). EMT is common in carcinogenic transformation of epithelial cells. CATLE cells showed increased KRAS (291{\%}), ERK1/2 (274{\%}), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK; 152{\%}), and phosphorylated AKT1 (p-AKT1; 170{\%}) protein expression. Increased transcript expression of metallothioneins, MT1A and MT2A and the stress response genes HMOX1 (690{\%}) and HIF1A (247{\%}) occurred in CATLE cells possibly in adaptation to chronic arsenic exposure. Thus, arsenic induced multiple cancer cell characteristics in human peripheral lung epithelial cells. This model may be useful to assess mechanisms of arsenic-induced lung cancer.},

The plasma Big ET-1 levels were measured using a one-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit. Significant increase in Big ET-1 levels were observed with the increasing concentrations of As in drinking water, hair and nails. Further, before and after adjusting with different covariates, plasma Big ET-1 levels were found to be significantly associated with the water, hair and nail As concentrations of the study subjects. Big ET-1 levels were also higher in the higher exposure groups compared to the lowest (reference) group. Interestingly, we observed that Big ET-1 levels were significantly higher in the hypertensive and skin lesion groups compared to the normotensive and without skin lesion counterpart, respectively of the study subjects in As-endemic areas. Thus, this study demonstrated a novel dose-response relationship between As exposure and plasma Big ET-1 levels indicating the possible involvement of plasma Big ET-1 levels in As-induced hypertension and skin lesions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Although fish and seafood are well known for their nutritional benefits, they contain contaminants that might affect human health. Organic lipid-soluble arsenic species, so called arsenolipids, belong to the emerging contaminants in these food items; their toxicity has yet to be systematically studied. Here, we apply the in vivo model Caenorhabditis elegans to assess the effects of two arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC), a saturated arsenic-containing fatty acid (AsFA), and an arsenic-containing triacylglyceride (AsTAG) in a whole organism. Although all arsenolipids were highly bioavailable in Caenorhabditis elegans , only the AsHCs were substantially metabolized to thioxylated or shortened metabolic products and induced significant toxicity, affecting both survival and development. Furthermore, the AsHCs were several fold more potent as compared to the toxic reference arsenite. This study clearly indicates the need for a full hazard identification of subclasses of arsenolipids to assess whether they pose a risk to human health. },

@article{Imran2010,
	abstract = {Context: Urine specific gravity (USG) is often used by clinicians to estimate urine osmolality. USG is measured either by refractometry or by reagent strip. Objective: We studied the correlation of USG obtained by either method with a concurrently obtained osmolality. Design: Using our laboratory's records, we retrospectively gathered data on 504 urine specimens on patients on whom a simultaneously drawn USG and an osmolality were available. Out of these, 253 USG's were measured by automated refractometry and 251 USG's were measured by reagent strip. Urinalysis data on these subjects were used to determine the correlation between USG and osmolality, adjusting for other variables that may impact the relationship. The other variables considered were pH, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrates, bilirubin, urobilinogen, hemoglobin, and leukocyte esterase. The relationships were analyzed by linear regression. Results: This study demonstrated that USG obtained by both reagent strip and refractometry had a correlation of approximately 0.75 with urine osmolality. The variables affecting the correlation included pH, ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen, glucose, and protein for the reagent strip and ketones, bilirubin, and hemoglobin for the refractometry method. At a pH of 7 and with an USG of 1.010 predicted osmolality is approximately 300 mosm/kg/H2O for either method. For an increase in SG of 0.010, predicted osmolality increases by 182 mosm/kg/H2O for the reagent strip and 203 mosm/kg/H2O for refractometry. Pathological urines had significantly poorer correlation between USG and osmolality than ``clean'' urines. Conclusion: In pathological urines, direct measurement of urine osmolality should be used.

Objectives: Follow-up of arsenic exposure and children's cognitive abilities at school-age. Methods: In a nested sub-cohort of the MINIMat supplementation trial, we assessed cognitive abilities at 10 years of age (n = 1523), using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV). Arsenic in maternal urine and erythrocytes in early pregnancy, in child urine at 5 and 10 years, and in hair at 10 years, was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Results: Median urinary arsenic at 10 years was 58 µg/L (range 7.3--940 µg/L). Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis showed that, compared to the first urinary arsenic quintile at 10 years ({\textless}30 µg/L), the third and fourth quintiles (30--45 and 46--73 µg/L, respectively) had 6--7 points lower Full developmental raw scores (B: −7.23, 95{\%} CI −11.3; −3.18, and B: −6.37, 95{\%} CI −10.5; −2.22, respectively), corresponding to {\~{}}0.2 SD. Verbal comprehension and Perceptual reasoning seemed to be affected. Models with children's hair arsenic concentrations showed similar results. Maternal urinary arsenic in early pregnancy, but not late pregnancy, showed inverse associations with Full developmental scores (quintiles 2--4: B: −4.52, 95{\%} CI −8.61; −0.43, B: −5.91, 95{\%} CI −10.0; −1.77, and B: −5.98, 95{\%}CI −10.2; −1.77, respectively, compared to first quintile), as well as with Verbal comprehension, Perceptual reasoning, and Processing speed, especially in girls (p {\textless} 0.05 for interaction of sex with Full developmental scores and Perceptual reasoning). In models with all exposure time points included, both concurrent exposure at 10 years and early prenatal exposure remained associated with cognitive abilities. Conclusions: Both early prenatal and childhood arsenic exposure, even at low levels (about 50 µg/L in urine), was inversely associated with cognitive abilities at school-age, although the estimates were modest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a potent human carcinogen and toxicant. Elevated concentration of arsenic in drinking water is a major public-health problem worldwide. We evaluated risks of adult mortality (due to cancer and cardiovascular and infectious diseases) in relation to arsenic exposure through drinking water. METHODS: A cohort analysis was applied to survival data prospectively collected during 1991-2000 in a health and demographic surveillance system in Matlab, Bangladesh, where tubewells were installed beginning in the early 1970s. A total of 115,903 persons aged 15 or more years on 1 January 1991 were available for analysis. In this period, 9015 people died and 22,488 were lost to follow-up. Arsenic exposure data were derived from a survey in 2002-2003 of past and current water use and arsenic concentrations in all tubewells. We estimated risk of excess mortality in relation to arsenic exposure, using proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Even at low levels (10-49 mug/L) of arsenic in drinking water, we observed increased risk of death due to all nonaccidental causes (hazard ratio = 1.16 [95{\%} confidence interval = 1.06-1.26]). Increased risks at exposure of 50-149 microg/L were observed for death due to cancers (1.44 [1.06-1.95]), cardiovascular disease (1.16 [0.96-1.40]), and infectious diseases (1.30 [1.13-1.49]). We observed clear dose-response relationships for each of these causes. CONCLUSIONS: Arsenic exposure through drinking water has generated excess adult mortality after 20-30 years of exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure currently affects {\textgreater}100 million persons  worldwide. Methylation of ingested inorganic arsenic (InAs) to monomethylarsonic (MMAs) and dimethylarsinic (DMAs) acids relies on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary arsenic elimination. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that folic acid supplementation to arsenic-exposed Bangladeshi adults would increase arsenic methylation and thereby lower total blood arsenic. DESIGN: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated blood concentrations of total arsenic, InAs, MMAs, and DMAs in 130 participants with low plasma folate ({\textless}9 nmol/L) before and after 12 wk of supplementation with folic acid (400 microg/d) or placebo. RESULTS: MMAs in blood was reduced by a mean +/- SE of 22.24 +/- 2.86{\%} in the folic acid supplementation group and by 1.24 +/- 3.59{\%} in the placebe group (P {\textless} 0.0001). There was no change in DMAs in blood; DMAs is rapidly excreted in urine as evidenced by an increase in urinary DMAs (P = 0.0099). Total blood arsenic was reduced by 13.62{\%} in the folic acid supplementation group and by 2.49{\%} in the placebo group (P = 0.0199). CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid supplementation to participants with low plasma concentrations of folate lowered blood arsenic concentrations, primarily by decreasing blood MMAs and increasing urinary DMAs. Therapeutic strategies to facilitate arsenic methylation, particularly in populations with folate deficiency or hyperhomocysteinemia or both, may lower blood arsenic concentrations and thereby contribute to the prevention of arsenic-induced illnesses.},

	abstract = {The use of arsenic (As) contaminated groundwater for irrigation of crops has resulted in elevated concentrations of arsenic in agricultural soils in Bangladesh, West Bengal (India), and elsewhere. Paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main agricultural crop grown in the arsenic-affected areas of Bangladesh. There is, therefore, concern regarding accumulation of arsenic in rice grown those soils. A greenhouse study was conducted to examine the effects of arsenic-contaminated irrigation water on the growth of rice and uptake and speciation of arsenic. Treatments of the greenhouse experiment consisted of two phosphate doses and seven different arsenate concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 mg of As L(-1) applied regularly throughout the 170-day post-transplantation growing period until plants were ready for harvesting. Increasing the concentration of arsenate in irrigation water significantly decreased plant height, grain yield, the number of filled grains, grain weight, and root biomass, while the arsenic concentrations in root, straw, and rice husk increased significantly. Concentrations of arsenic in rice grain did not exceed the food hygiene concentration limit (1.0 mg of As kg(-1) dry weight). The concentrations of arsenic in rice straw (up to 91.8 mg kg(-1) for the highest As treatment) were of the same order of magnitude as root arsenic concentrations (up to 107.5 mg kg(-1)), suggesting that arsenic can be readily translocated to the shoot. While not covered by food hygiene regulations, rice straw is used as cattle feed in many countries including Bangladesh. The high arsenic concentrations may have the potential for adverse health effects on the cattle and an increase of arsenic exposure in humans via the plant-animal-human pathway. Arsenic concentrations in rice plant parts except husk were not affected by application of phosphate. As the concentration of arsenic in the rice grain was low, arsenic speciation was performed only on rice straw to predict the risk associated with feeding contaminated straw to the cattle. Speciation of arsenic in tissues (using HPLC-ICP-MS) revealed that the predominant species present in straw was arsenate followed by arsenite and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA). As DMAA is only present at low concentrations, it is unlikely this will greatly alter the toxicity of arsenic present in rice.},

@article{Vineis2020,
	abstract = {The exposome concept refers to the totality of exposures from a variety of external and internal sources including chemical agents, biological agents, or radiation, from conception onward, over a complete lifetime. It encompasses also ``psychosocial components'' including the impact of social relations and socio-economic position on health. In this review we provide examples of recent contributions from exposome research, where we believe their application will be of the greatest value for moving forward. So far, environmental epidemiology has mainly focused on hard outcomes, such as mortality, disease exacerbation and hospitalizations. However, there are many subtle outcomes that can be related to environmental exposures, and investigations can be facilitated by an improved understanding of internal biomarkers of exposure and response, through the application of omic technologies. Second, though we have a wealth of studies on environmental pollutants, the assessment of causality is often difficult because of confounding, reverse causation and other uncertainties. Biomarkers and omic technologies may allow better causal attribution, for example using instrumental variables in triangulation, as we discuss here. Even more complex is the understanding of how social relationships (in particular socio-economic differences) influence health and imprint on the fundamental biology of the individual. The identification of molecular changes that are intermediate between social determinants and disease status is a way to fill the gap. Another field in which biomarkers and omics are relevant is the study of mixtures. Epidemiology often deals with complex mixtures (e.g. ambient air pollution, food, smoking) without fully disentangling the compositional complexity of the mixture, or with rudimentary approaches to reflect the overall effect of multiple exposures or components. From the point of view of disease mechanisms, most models hypothesize that several stages need to be transitioned through health to the induction of disease, but very little is known about the characteristics and temporal sequence of such stages. Exposome models reinforce the idea of a biography-to-biology transition, in that everyone's disease is the product of the individual history of exposures, superimposed on their underlying genetic susceptibilities. Finally, exposome research is facilitated by technological developments that complement traditional epidemiological study designs. We describe in depth one such new tools, adductomics. In general, the development of high-resolution and high-throughput technologies interrogating multiple -omics (such as epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, adductomics and metabolomics) yields an unprecedented perspective into the impact of the environment in its widest sense on disease. The world of the exposome is rapidly evolving, though a huge gap still needs to be filled between the original expectations and the concrete achievements. Perhaps the most urgent need is for the establishment of a new generation of cohort studies with appropriately specified biosample collection, improved questionnaire data (including social variables), and the deployment of novel technologies that allow better characterization of individual environmental exposures, ranging from personal monitoring to satellite based observations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is thought to result from an accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over time. Yet it is possible that a normal decline in FEV1 could also lead to COPD in persons whose maximally attained FEV1 is less than population norms. METHODS We stratified participants in three independent cohorts (the Framingham Offspring Cohort, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, and the Lovelace Smokers Cohort) according to lung function (FEV1 ≥80{\%} or {\textless}80{\%} of the predicted value) at cohort inception (mean age of patients, approximately 40 years) and the presence or absence of COPD at the last study visit. We then determined the rate of decline in FEV1 over time among the participants according to their FEV1 at cohort inception and COPD status at study end. RESULTS Among 657 persons who had an FEV1 of less than 80{\%} of the predicted value before 40 years of age, 174 (26{\%}) had COPD after 22 years of observation, whereas among 2207 persons who had a baseline FEV1 of at least 80{\%} of the predicted value before 40 years of age, 158 (7{\%}) had COPD after 22 years of observation (P{\textless}0.001). Approximately half the 332 persons with COPD at the end of the observation period had had a normal FEV1 before 40 years of age and had a rapid decline in FEV1 thereafter, with a mean ($\pm$SD) decline of 53$\pm$21 ml per year. The remaining half had had a low FEV1 in early adulthood and a subsequent mean decline in FEV1 of 27$\pm$18 ml per year (P{\textless}0.001), despite similar smoking exposure. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that low FEV1 in early adulthood is important in the genesis of COPD and that accelerated decline in FEV1 is not an obligate feature of COPD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for the newborn infant. However, since all infants cannot be breast-fed, there is a need for background data for setting adequate daily intakes. Previously, concentration data on major essential elements and some toxic elements in breast milk, based on different analytical techniques, have been published. There is no recent study on a large number of metals and trace elements in breast milk, using a sensitive analytical method for determination of low element concentrations. METHODS: Breast milk concentrations of 32 metals and elements in early lactation (days 14-21) were determined in a random sample of first time Swedish mothers (n = 60) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). RESULTS: There were small inter-individual concentration variations in the macroelements Ca, K, Mg, P and S, and striking similarities across studies and over time, supporting a tight regulation of these elements in breast milk. Large inter-individual and over time differences were detected for Na concentrations, which may reflect an increase in salt consumption in Swedish women. Large inter-individual differences were also detected for the microelements Co, Cr, Mn and Mo, and the toxic metals As, Cd, Pb, Sb and V. Arsenic and B were positively correlated with fish consumption, indicating influence of maternal intake on breast milk concentrations. Observed differences in breast milk element concentrations across studies and over time could be attributed to the timing of sampling and a general decline over time of lactation (Cu, Fe, Mo, Zn), a possible lack of regulation of certain elements in breast milk (As, B, Co, Mn, Se) and time trends in environmental exposure (Pb), or in some cases to differences in analytical performance (Cr, Fe). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides reliable updated information on a number of metals and elements in breast milk, of which some have not previously been reported.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of arsenic in groundwater is a recognized environmental hazard with worldwide importance and much effort has been focused on surveying and predicting where arsenic occurs. Temporal variability is one aspect of this environmental hazard that has until recently received less attention than other aspects. For this study, we analyzed 1245 wells with two samples per well. We suggest that temporal variability, often reported as affecting very few wells, is perhaps a larger issue than it appears and has been overshadowed by datasets with large numbers of non-detect data. Although there was only a slight difference in arsenic concentration variability among samples from public and private wells (p. =. 0.0452), the range of variability was larger for public than for private wells. Further, we relate the variability we see to geochemical factors-primarily variability in redox-but also variability in major-ion chemistry. We also show that in New England there is a weak but statistically significant indication that seasonality may have an effect on concentrations, whereby concentrations in the first two quarters of the year (January-June) are significantly lower than in the second two quarters (July-December) (p. {\textless}. 0.0001). In the Central Valley of California, the relation of arsenic concentration to season was not statistically significant (p. =. 0.4169). In New England, these changes appear to follow groundwater levels. It is possible that this difference in arsenic concentrations is related to groundwater level changes, pumping stresses, evapotranspiration effects, or perhaps mixing of more oxidizing, lower pH recharge water in wetter months. Focusing on the understanding the geochemical conditions in aquifers where arsenic concentrations are concerns and causes of geochemical changes in the groundwater environment may lead to a better understanding of where and by how much arsenic will vary over time.},

	abstract = {Some paddy soils in the Bengal delta are contaminated with arsenic (As) due to irrigation of As-laden groundwater, which may lead to yield losses and elevated As transfer to the food chain. Whether these soils have a higher As bioavailability than other soils containing either geogenic As or contaminated by mining activities was investigated in a pot experiment. Fourteen soils varying in the source and the degree (4-138 mg As kg 1⁻¹) of As contamination were collected, 10 from Bangladeshi paddy fields (contaminated by irrigation water) and two each from China and the UK (geogenic or mining impacted), for comparison. Bangladeshi soils had higher percentages of the total As extractable by ammonium phosphate (specifically sorbed As) than other soils and also released more As into the porewater upon flooding. Porewater As concentrations increased with increasing soil As concentrations more steeply in Bangladeshi soils, with arsenite being the dominant As species. Rice growth and grain yield decreased markedly in Bangladeshi soils containing {\textgreater} 13 mg As kg 1⁻¹, but not in the other soils. Phosphate-extractable or porewater As was a better indicator of As bioavailability than total soil As. Rice straw As concentrations increased with increasing soil As concentrations; however, As phytotoxicity appeared to result in lower grain As concentrations. The relative proportions of inorganic As and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) in grain varied among soils, and the percentage DMA was larger in greenhouse-grown plants than grain samples collected from the paddy fields of the same soil and the same rice cultivar, indicating a strong environmental influence on As species found in rice grain. This study shows that Bangladeshi paddy soils contaminated by irrigation had a higher As bioavailability than other soils, resulting in As phytotoxicity in rice and substantial yield losses.},

	abstract = {Stabilized rice bran (SRB), a source of complex carbohydrates, tocols, ??-oryzanols, and polyphenols, was treated with carbohydrases and heat to yield two fractions, rice bran water solubles (RBWS), and rice bran fiber concentrates (RBFC). Stabilized rice bran and its fractions were fed for 60 days to insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM = Type I and NIDDM = Type II) subjects to determine possible effects on serum hemoglobin, carbohydrate and lipid parameters. The Type I subjects (n = 22, 26, and 20) fed Stabilized rice bran, rice bran water solubles, and rice bran fiber concentrates plus AHA Step-1 diet reduced glycosylated hemoglobin 1{\%}, 11{\%}, and 10{\%}, respectively. The fasting serum glucose levels were also reduced significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) with stabilized rice bran (9{\%}), rice bran water solubles (29{\%}), and rice bran fiber concentrates (19{\%}). The Type II subjects (n = 31, and 26) fed rice bran water solubles and rice bran fiber concentrates plus AHA Step-1 diet had decreased levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (15{\%} and 11{\%}) and fasting glucose (33{\%} and 22{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. Serum insulin levels were increased (4{\%}) with rice bran water solubles in both types of diabetes. The reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin and a slight increase in insulin levels indicate that consumption of rice bran water solubles can control blood glucose levels in human diabetes. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides levels were reduced with rice bran fiber concentrates in the Type I (10, 16, 10, 7{\%}) and Type II groups (12, 15, 10, 8{\%}), respectively. These results indicate that rice bran water solubles significantly reduces hyperglycemia (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas rice bran fiber concentrates reduces hyperlipidemia (P {\textless} 0.05) in both types of diabetes. Therefore, these natural products can be used as nutritional supplements for the control of both types of diabetes mellitus in humans. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

We report results of a cross-sectional investigation of intellectual function in 201 children 10 years of age whose parents participate in our ongoing prospective cohort study examining health effects of As exposure in 12,000 residents of Araihazar, Bangladesh. Water As and manganese concentrations of tube wells at each child's home were obtained by surveying all wells in the study region. Children and mothers came to our field clinic, where children received a medical examination in which weight, height, and head circumference were measured. Children's intellectual function on tests drawn from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, version III, was assessed by summing weighted items across domains to create Verbal, Performance, and Full-Scale raw scores. Children provided urine specimens for measuring urinary As and creatinine and were asked to provide blood samples for measuring blood lead and hemoglobin concentrations. Exposure to As from drinking water was associated with reduced intellectual function after adjustment for sociodemographic covariates and water Mn. Water As was associated with reduced intellectual function, in a dose-response manner, such that children with water As levels {\textgreater} 50 microg/L achieved significantly lower Performance and Full-Scale scores than did children with water As levels {\textless} 5.5 microg/L. The association was generally stronger for well-water As than for urinary As.},

@article{Levin-Schwartz2019,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to mixtures of chemicals across their lifetimes, a concept sometimes called the "exposome." Mixtures likely have temporal "critical windows" of susceptibility like single agents and measuring them repeatedly might help to define such windows. Common approaches to evaluate the effects of chemical mixtures have focused on their effects at a single time point. Our goal is to expand upon these previous techniques and examine the time-varying critical windows for metal mixtures on subsequent neurobehavior in children. METHODS: We propose two methods, joint weighted quantile sum regression (JWQS) and meta-weighted quantile sum regression (MWQS), to estimate the effects of chemical mixtures measured across multiple time points, while providing data on their critical windows of exposure. We compare the performance of both methods using simulations. We also applied both techniques to assess second and third trimester metal mixture effects in predicting performance in the Rapid Visual Processing (RVP) task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) assessed at 6-9 years in children who are part of the PROGRESS (Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth, Environment and Social Stressors) longitudinal cohort study. The metals, arsenic, cadmium (Cd), cesium, chromium, lead (Pb) and antimony (Sb) were selected based on their toxicological profile. RESULTS: In simulations, JWQS and MWQS had over 80{\%} accuracy in classifying exposures as either strongly or weakly contributing to an association. In real data, both JWQS and MWQS consistently found that Pb and Cd exposure jointly predicted longer latency in the RVP and that second trimester exposure better predicted the results than the third trimester. Additionally, both JWQS and MWQS highlighted the strong association Cd and Sb had with lower accuracy in the RVP and that third trimester exposure was a better predictor than second trimester exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that metal mixtures effects vary across time, have distinct critical windows and that both JWQS and MWQS can determine longitudinal mixture effects including the cumulative contribution of each exposure and critical windows of effect.},

	abstract = {Background: The European Union's 7th Framework Programme (EU's FP7) project HEALS -- Health and Environment-wide Associations based on Large Population Surveys -- aims a refinement of the methodology to elucidate the human exposome. Human biomonitoring (HBM) provides a valuable tool for understanding the magnitude of human exposure from all pathways and sources. However, availability of specific biomarkers of exposure (BoE) is limited. Objectives: The objective was to summarize the availability of BoEs for a broad range of environmental stressors and exposure determinants and corresponding reference and exposure limit values and biomonitoring equivalents useful for unraveling the exposome using the framework of environment-wide association studies (EWAS). Methods: In a face-to-face group discussion, scope, content, and structure of the HEALS deliverable ``Guidelines for appropriate BoE selection for EWAS studies'' were determined. An expert-driven, distributed, narrative review process involving around 30 individuals of the HEALS consortium made it possible to include extensive information targeted towards the specific characteristics of various environmental stressors and exposure determinants. From the resulting 265 page report, targeted information about BoE, corresponding reference values (e.g., 95th percentile or measures of central tendency), exposure limit values (e.g., the German HBM I and II values) and biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) were summarized and updated. Results: 64 individual biological, chemical, physical, psychological and social environmental stressors or exposure determinants were included to fulfil the requirements of EWAS. The list of available BoEs is extensive with a number of 135; however, 12 of the stressors and exposure determinants considered do not leave any measurable specific substance in accessible body specimens. Opportunities to estimate the internal exposure stressors not (yet) detectable in human specimens were discussed. Conclusions: Data about internal exposures are useful to decode the exposome. The paper provides extensive information for EWAS. Information included serves as a guideline -- snapshot in time without any claim to comprehensiveness -- to interpret HBM data and offers opportunities to collect information about the internal exposure of stressors if no specific BoE is available.},

Using the ISAAC phase III questionnaire, parents reported chest and nose symptoms, food intake, weight, height and other factors, including exercise. A Mediterranean diet score was developed. A distinction was made between current occasional asthma (COA) and current severe asthma (CSA).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Independent of the amount of exercise, each Mediterranean score unit had a small but protective effect on CSA in girls (adjusted OR 0.90, 95{\%} CI 0.82 to 0.98).

Obesity was a risk factor for CSA in girls (adjusted OR 2.35, 95{\%} CI 1.51 to 3.64). Individually, a more frequent intake (1-2 times/week and{\textgreater}or=3 times/week vs never/occasionally) of seafood (adjusted ORs 0.63 (95{\%} CI 0.44 to 0.91) and 0.53 (95{\%} CI 0.35 to 0.80)) and cereals (adjusted OR 0.56 (95{\%} CI 0.30 to 1.02) and 0.39 (95{\%} CI 0.23 to 0.68)) were protective factors for CSA, while fast food was a risk factor (adjusted ORs 1.64 (95{\%} CI 1.28 to 2.10) and 2.26 (95{\%} CI 1.09 to 4.68)).

	abstract = {Environmental exposure to heavy metals is a well-known risk factor for cancers. To evaluate potential health risks of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb, As and Hg) and Se in cultivated topsoil and grains, we investigated the concentrations of Hg, As and Se using atomic fluorescence spectrometry and Cr, Cd and Pb using inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-MS). We also analyzed human cancer tissues for heavy metals. Potential health risks for local residents were evaluated by calculating the hazard index (HI) and the total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for soil heavy metals and the target hazard quotient (THQ) and the carcinogenic risk (CR) for grain heavy metals. A bioconcentration factor (BCF) was applied to quantify the bioaccumulation of heavy metals. Our results demonstrated that the mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were all within the safety limits set by FAO/WHO and Chinese regulations; however, the mean concentrations of Cr and Hg in grain exceeded the safety limits. HI and TCR for soil heavy metals were all within acceptable levels, but the THQ for four grain heavy metals exceeded the target value of 1 (Cr, 2.64; Pb, 1.41; As, 1.24; Hg, 1.07; Cd, 0.39). The grain CR for Cr, Pb and As exceeded the accepted risk level of 10-6. BCF values indicated that the bioaccumulation capacity decreased in the following sequence: Hg{\textgreater}Se{\textgreater}Cd{\textgreater}Cr{\textgreater}Pb{\textgreater}As. We also observed statistically significant correlations of topsoil Pb concentration with human gastric cancer and grain Hg with human liver cancer. Therefore, long-term low dose exposure of heavy metals may play a key role in tumorigenesis, and it may not be necessary to accumulate a high concentration of heavy metals in the human body for those metals to induce tumorigenesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A pilot study was conducted to determine the applicability of toenails as a biomarker of exposure to elevated environmental arsenic ( As) levels. A total of 17 individuals were recruited for the pilot study: 8 residents living near to a former As mine, Devon, UK, forming the exposed group, plus 9 residents from Nottinghamshire, UK, with no anticipated As exposure who were used for comparison as a control group. All toenail samples were thoroughly washed prior to analysis and the wash solutions retained for As determination via ICP-MS to provide an indication of the background environmental As levels for each group. Total As was determined in washed toenail samples via ICP-MS following microwave assisted acid digestion. Concentrations of total As in the toenails of the exposed group were elevated, ranging from 858 to 25 981 mu g kg(-1) (geometric mean 5406 mu g kg(-1)), compared to the control group whose toenail As concentrations ranged from 73 to 273 mu g kg(-1) (geometric mean 122 mu g kg(-1)). Higher levels of exogenous As contamination were present on the toenails of the exposed group (geometric mean 506 mu g kg(-1)) compared to the control group (geometricmean 4.0 mu g kg(-1)) providing evidence of higher environmental As levels in the exposed group. Total As concentrations in toenail samples were positively correlated to environmental As levels (r = 0.60, p {\textless} 0.001). HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of aqueous toenail extracts revealed inorganic arsenite (As(III)) to be the dominant species extracted (similar to 83{\%}) with lesser amounts of inorganic arsenate (As(V)) and organic dimethylarsinate (DMA(V)) at similar to 13{\%} and similar to 8.5{\%}, respectively. Arsenic speciation in analysed toenail extracts from the two groups was comparable. The only notable difference between groups was the presence of small amounts ({\textless} 1{\%}) of organic methylarsonate (MA(V)) in two toenail samples from the exposed group. Toenails are presented as a viable biomarker of exposure at sites with elevated environmental As, such as the former mining sites found throughout Devon and Cornwall, UK.},

@article{Liang2020,
	abstract = {The relationship between prenatal arsenic exposure at low levels and poor development in children, especially in regard to neurodevelopment, has aroused several concerns, but the conclusions have been inconsistent. It still remains unclear whether such adverse effect is associated with a specific profile of the developing brain in early life. To investigate the association between arsenic exposure in utero and children's development and behaviour, we performed a large prospective birth cohort study including 2315 mother-infant pairs in Anhui Province, China. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire of China (ASQ-C) was used to assess the status of children's development and behaviour at 6 months postpartum, and the levels of arsenic were determined in umbilical cord serum samples. Odds ratios for suspected developmental delay (SDD) in each domain of the ASQ-C clusters were estimated using logistic regression models. Compared with low arsenic levels group, medium and high arsenic levels were significantly associated with the increased risks of SDD in the personal-social domain among infants aged 6 months after adjustment for all potential confounders (OR = 1.33, 95{\%} CI (1.01, 1.75) and OR = 1.47, 95{\%} CI (1.08, 2.00), respectively). Sex stratification analysis demonstrated that this association was stronger in females. The sensitivity analyses also showed that high cord serum arsenic levels were associated with a 1.80-fold (95{\%} CIs (1.12, 2.90)) higher risk of a more severe developmental delay in the personal-social domain among six-month-old females. Our results suggest that low-level arsenic exposure in utero could have an adverse domain-specific effect on children's development at 6 months of age, particularly among females. Further studies are warranted to support the findings and explore the mechanism of these domain-and sex-specific associations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to arsenic through drinking water has been associated with impaired cognitive function in school-aged children in a few cross-sectional studies; however, there is little information on critical windows of exposure.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based longitudinal study in rural Bangladesh. We assessed the association of arsenic exposure, based on urinary arsenic (U-As; twice during pregnancy and twice in childhood), with the development of about 1700 children at 5 years of age using Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence [intelligence quotient (IQ)].

RESULTS: Median maternal U-As in pregnancy was 80 µg/l (10-90 percentiles: 25-400 µg/l). Children's urine contained 35 (12-155) µg/l and 51 (20-238) µg/l at 1.5 and 5 years, respectively. Using multivariable-adjusted regression analyses, controlling for all potential confounders and loss to follow-up, we found that verbal IQ (VIQ) and full scale IQ (FSIQ) were negatively associated with (log) U-As in girls. The associations were consistent, but somewhat stronger with concurrent arsenic exposure [VIQ: B = -2.4, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = -3.8 to -1.1; FSIQ: B = -1.4, 95{\%} CI = -2.7 to -0.1, n = 817), compared with that at 1.5 years (VIQ: B = -0.85, 95{\%} CI = -2.1 to 0.4; FSIQ: B = -0.74, 95{\%} CI = -1.9 to 0.4, n = 902), late gestation (VIQ: B = -1.52, 95{\%} CI = -2.6 to -0.4; FSIQ: B = -1.35, 95{\%} CI = -2.4 to -0.3, n = 874) and early gestation (VIQ: B = -1.23, 95{\%} CI = -2.4 to -0.06; FSIQ: B = -0.92, 95{\%} CI = -2.0 to -0.2, n = 833). In boys, U-As showed consistently low and non-significant associations with all IQ measures. An effect size calculation indicated that 100 µg/l U-As was associated with a decrement of 1-3 points in both VIQ and FSIQ in girls.

CONCLUSION: We found adverse effects of arsenic exposure on IQ in girls, but not boys, at 5 years of age.},

	abstract = {Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide affecting all age groups from children to the elderly. In addition to other factors such as smoking, air pollution and atopy, some environmental chemicals are shown or suspected to increase the risk of asthma, exacerbate asthma symptoms and cause other respiratory symptoms. In this scoping review, we report environmental chemicals, prioritized for investigation in the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU), which are associated or possibly associated with asthma. The substance groups considered to cause asthma through specific sensitization include: diisocyanates, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) and possibly p-phenylenediamine (p-PDA). In epidemiological studies, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organophosphate insecticides are associated with asthma, and phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pyrethroid insecticides, mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead are only potentially associated with asthma. As a conclusion, exposure to PAHs and some pesticides are associated with increased risk of asthma. Diisocyanates and Cr(VI) cause asthma with specific sensitization. For many environmental chemicals, current studies have provided contradicting results in relation to increased risk of asthma. Therefore, more research about exposure to environmental chemicals and risk of asthma is needed.},

	abstract = {Background: In previous studies, exposures to heavy metals such as Pb and Cd have been associated with adverse birth outcomes; however, knowledge on effects at low levels of exposure and of other elements remain limited. Method: We examined individual and mixture effects of metals and metalloids on birth outcomes among 812 pregnant women in the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) cohort. We measured 16 essential and non-essential metal(loid)s in maternal blood collected at 16--20 and 24--28 weeks gestation. We used linear and logistic regression to independently examine associations between geometric mean (GM) concentrations of each metal across visits and gestational age, birthweight z-scores, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), and large for gestational age (LGA). We evaluated effect modification with infant sex*metal interaction terms. To identify critical windows of susceptibility, birth outcomes were regressed on visit-specific metal concentrations. Furthermore, average metal concentrations were divided into tertiles to examine the potential for non-linear relationships. We used elastic net (ENET) regularization to construct Environmental Risk Score (ERS) as a metal risk score and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to identify individual metals most critical to each outcome, accounting for correlated exposures. Results: In adjusted models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in GM lead (Pb) was associated with 1.63 higher odds of preterm birth (95{\%}CI = 1.17, 2.28) and 2 days shorter gestational age (95{\%} CI = −3.1, −0.5). Manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) were also associated with higher odds of preterm birth and shorter gestational age; the associations were strongest among the highest tertile for Mn and among females for Zn. Mercury (Hg) was associated with higher risk of preterm birth at the later window of pregnancy. Ni measured later in pregnancy was associated with lower odds of SGA. ENET and BKMR models selected similar metals as ``important'' predictors of birth outcomes. The association between ERS and preterm birth was assessed and the third tertile of ERS was significantly associated with an elevated odds ratio of 2.13 (95{\%} CI = 1.12, 5.49) for preterm birth compared to the first tertile. Conclusion: As the PROTECT cohort has lower Pb concentrations (GM = 0.33 $\mu$g/dL) compared to the mainland US, our findings suggest that low-level prenatal lead exposure, as well as elevated Mn and Zn exposure, may adversely affect birth outcomes. Improved understanding on environmental factors contributing to preterm birth, together with sustainable technologies to remove contamination, will have a direct impact in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Background: Manganese (Mn) is an element found in the environment and certain geographic areas have elevated concentrations in soil and water du to natural conditions or anthropic activities. A growing body of data suggests that exposure to manganese in drinking water could be neurotoxic. Objective: Firstly, we aimed to examine the association between exposure to manganese from drinking water and cognition in children consuming well water. Secondly, we also aimed to examine the relation between cognition and manganese concentrations in children's hair, nail, and saliva. Methods: A total 259 children from 189 households consuming well water were included in the present study (ages 5.9 to 13.7 years). We assessed children's cognition with the WISC-IV, and we used five indicators of manganese exposure: concentration in tap water, intake from the consumption of water divided by child's weight, manganese concentration in children's hair, toe nail, and saliva. We used General Estimating Equation analysis to assess the relation between manganese exposure indicators and IQ scores, adjusting for potential confounders, and taking into account family clusters. Results: Drinking water manganese concentrations were generally low, with 48{\%} of children consuming water {\textless}5. {\textgreater}g/L, 25{\%} {\textgreater}50. {\textgreater}g/L, and 4{\%} {\textgreater}400. {\textgreater}g/L. Results differed by sex. In girls, higher manganese concentration in water, hair, and toe nail were associated with poorer Performance IQ scores but this was significant only for toe nail (for a 10-fold increase in manganese, $\beta$: -5.65, 95{\%} CIs: -10.97, -0.32). Opposite associations were observed in boys, i.e., better Performance IQ scores with higher manganese concentration hair, toe nail, and water, the latter being significant ($\beta$: 2.66, 95{\%} CIs: 0.44, 4.89). Verbal IQ scores did not seem to be associated with manganese exposure indicators. Conclusions: Drinking water manganese levels were considerably lower than in previous studies reporting neurotoxic effects. There was no clear indication of an association between exposure to manganese and cognitive development in this sample of school-age children although the data suggest there might be sex-specific associations. Given the low levels of exposure and sex-specific associations, a larger sample size would have been required to increase the statistical power and better characterize the relations.},

	abstract = {It is shown that the overall effect of an exposure on an outcome, in the presence of a mediator with which the exposure may interact, can be decomposed into four components: (i) the effect of the exposure in the absence of the mediator, (ii) the interactive effect when the mediator is left to what it would be in the absence of exposure, (iii) a mediated interaction, and (iv) a pure mediated effect. These four components, respectively, correspond to the portion of the effect that is due to neither mediation nor interaction, to just interaction (but not mediation), to both mediation and interaction, and to just mediation (but not interaction). This four-way decomposition unites methods that attribute effects to interactions and methods that assess mediation. Certain combinations of these four components correspond to measures for mediation, while other combinations correspond to measures of interaction previously proposed in the literature. Prior decompositions in the literature are in essence special cases of this four-way decomposition. The four-way decomposition can be carried out using standard statistical models, and software is provided to estimate each of the four components. The four-way decomposition provides maximum insight into how much of an effect is mediated, how much is due to interaction, how much is due to both mediation and interaction together, and how much is due to neither},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Among nonoccupationally exposed U.S. residents, drinking water and diet are considered primary exposure pathways for inorganic arsenic (iAs). In drinking water, iAs is the primary form of arsenic (As), while dietary As speciation techniques are used to differentiate iAs from less toxic arsenicals in food matrices. OBJECTIVES To estimate the distribution of iAs exposure rates from drinking water intakes and rice consumption in the U.S. population and ethnic- and age-based subpopulations. METHODS The distribution of iAs in drinking water was estimated by population, weighting the iAs concentrations for each drinking water utility in the Second Six-Year Review data set. To estimate the distribution of iAs concentrations in rice ingested by U.S. consumers, 54 grain-specific, production-weighted composites of rice obtained from U.S. mills were extracted and speciated using both a quantitative dilute nitric acid extraction and speciation (DNAS) and an in vitro gastrointestinal assay to provide an upper bound and bioaccessible estimates, respectively. Daily drinking water intake and rice consumption rate distributions were developed using data from the What We Eat in America (WWEIA) study. RESULTS Using these datasets, the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation (SHEDS) model estimated mean iAs exposures from drinking water and rice were 4.2 $\mu$g/day and 1.4 $\mu$g/day, respectively, for the entire U.S. population. The Tribal, Asian, and Pacific population exhibited the highest mean daily exposure of iAs from cooked rice (2.8 $\mu$g/day); the mean exposure rate for children between ages 1 and 2 years in this population is 0.104 $\mu$g/kg body weight (BW)-day. CONCLUSIONS An average consumer drinking 1.5 L of water daily that contains between 2 and 3 ng iAs/mL is exposed to approximately the same amount of iAs as a mean Tribal, Asian, and Pacific consumer is exposed to from rice.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of aerobic metabolism and can also act as signaling molecules to participate in multiple regulation of biological and physiological processes. The occurrence, growth and metastasis of tumors, and even the apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy of tumor cells are all closely related to ROS. However, ROS levels in the body are usually maintained at a stable status. ROS produced by oxidative stress can cause damage to cell lipids, protein and DNA. In recent years, ROS have achieved satisfactory results on the treatment of tumors. Therefore, this review summarizes some research results of tumor treatments from the perspective of ROS in recent years, and analyzes how to achieve the mechanism of inhibition and treatment of tumors by ROS or how to affect the tumor microenvironment by influencing ROS. At the same time, the detection methods of ROS, problems encountered in the research process and solutions are also summarized. The purpose of this review is to provide a clearer understanding of the ROS role in tumor treatment, so that researchers might have more inspiration and thoughts for cancer prevention and treatment in the next stage.},

	abstract = {In evaluation of cancer risk related to environmental chemical exposures, the effect of many chemicals on disease is ultimately of interest. However, because of potentially strong correlations among chemicals that occur together, traditional regression methods suffer from collinearity effects, including regression coefficient sign reversal and variance inflation. In addition, penalized regression methods designed to remediate collinearity may have limitations in selecting the truly bad actors among many correlated components. The recently proposed method of weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression attempts to overcome these problems by estimating a body burden index, which identifies important chemicals in a mixture of correlated environmental chemicals. Our focus was on assessing through simulation studies the accuracy of WQS regression in detecting subsets of chemicals associated with health outcomes (binary and continuous) in site-specific analyses and in non-site-specific analyses. We also evaluated the performance of the penalized regression methods of lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net in correctly classifying chemicals as bad actors or unrelated to the outcome. We based the simulation study on data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (NCI-SEER) case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) to achieve realistic exposure situations. Our results showed that WQS regression had good sensitivity and specificity across a variety of conditions considered in this study. The shrinkage methods had a tendency to incorrectly identify a large number of components, especially in the case of strong association with the outcome.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for arsenic speciation analysis in rice using ion chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Several procedures for the extraction of arsenic species from rice were investigated and compared. Treatment of the samples with 2�M trifluoroacetic acid for 6 h at 100[degree]C provided good extraction efficiency. Fortification recoveries were 83, 88, 100, and 93{\%} for arsenite (100�ng�As�g-1), arsenate (100�ng�As�g-1), methylarsonic acid (MMA, 50�ng�As�g-1), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA, 200�ng�As�g-1), respectively. The arsenate fortification recovery was calculated using the sum of the increase in arsenate and arsenite concentrations because arsenate was partially reduced to arsenite during the extraction process. Thus the sum of their concentrations is reported in this method as total inorganic arsenic. The sum of the arsenic species determined in NIST SRM 1568a rice flour (0.27�[micro sign]g�g-1�As), compared well with the certified total arsenic value (0.29�[micro sign]g�g-1�As). The speciation results obtained for 5 samples of long grain rice and one sample of wild rice are compared with total arsenic concentrations as determined by ICP-MS. The total arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.11 to 0.34�mg�kg-1. The sum of the arsenic species extracted and determined by IC-ICP-MS ranged from 84 to 99{\%} of the measured total arsenic concentrations. Inorganic arsenic accounted for 11-91{\%} of the arsenic detected while DMA accounted for most of the remaining arsenic in the samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Rice is an important dietary source for methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin, and inorganic arsenic (As), a human carcinogen. Rice baby cereals are a dietary source of inorganic As; however, less is known concerning MeHg concentrations in rice baby cereals and rice teething biscuits. 

METHODS
MeHg concentrations were measured in 36 rice baby cereals, eight rice teething biscuits, and four baby cereals manufactured with oats/wheat (n = 48 total). Arsenic (As) species, including inorganic As, were determined in rice baby cereals and rice teething biscuits (n = 44/48), while total As was determined in all products (n = 48). 

RESULTS
Rice baby cereals and rice teething biscuits were on average 61 and 92 times higher in MeHg, respectively, and 9.4 and 4.7 times higher in total As, respectively, compared to wheat/oat baby cereals. For a 15-g serving of rice baby cereal, average MeHg intake was 0.0092$\mu$gday−1 (range: 0.0013--0.034$\mu$gday−1), while average inorganic As intake was 1.3$\mu$gday−1 (range: 0.37--2.3$\mu$gday−1). Inorganic As concentrations in two brands of rice baby cereal (n = 12/36 boxes of rice cereal) exceeded 100ng/g, the proposed action level from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Log10 MeHg and inorganic As concentrations in rice baby cereals were strongly, positively correlated (Pearson's rho = 0.60, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 36). 

CONCLUSIONS
Rice-containing baby cereals and teething biscuits were a dietary source of both MeHg and inorganic As. Studies concerning the cumulative impacts of MeHg and inorganic As on offspring development are warranted.},

Concentrations of iAs in drinking water (DW-iAs) and maternal urinary concentrations of iAs and its monomethylated and dimethylated metabolites (MMAs and DMAs, respectively) were determined. Birth outcomes were analyzed for their relationship to DW-iAs and to the concentrations and proportions of maternal urinary arsenicals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: DW-iAs for the study subjects ranged from {\textless} 0.5 to 236 $\mu$g As/L. More than half of the women (53{\%}) had DW-iAs that exceeded the World Health Organization's recommended guideline of 10 $\mu$g As/L. DW-iAs was significantly associated with the sum of the urinary arsenicals (U-tAs). Maternal urinary concentrations of MMAs were negatively associated with newborn birth weight and gestational age. Maternal urinary concentrations of iAs were associated with lower mean gestational age and newborn length.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Biomonitoring results demonstrate that pregnant women in G{\'{o}}mez Palacio are exposed to potentially harmful levels of DW-iAs. The data support a relationship between iAs metabolism in pregnant women and adverse birth outcomes. The results underscore the risks associated with iAs exposure in vulnerable populations.},

	abstract = {Many Bangladeshi suffer from arsenic-related health concerns. Most mitigation activities focus on identifying contaminated wells and reducing the amount of arsenic ingested from well water. Food as a source of arsenic exposure has been recently documented. The objectives of this study were to measure the main types of arsenic in commonly consumed foods in Bangladesh and estimate the average daily intake (ADI) of arsenic from food and water. Total, organic and inorganic, arsenic were measured in drinking water and in cooked rice and vegetables from Bangladeshi households. The mean total arsenic level in 46 rice samples was 358 $\mu$g/kg (range: 46 to 1110 $\mu$g/kg dry weight) and 333 $\mu$g/kg (range: 19 to 2334 $\mu$g/kg dry weight) in 39 vegetable samples. Inorganic arsenic calculated as arsenite and arsenate made up 87{\%} of the total arsenic measured in rice, and 96{\%} of the total arsenic in vegetables. Total arsenic in water ranged from 200 to 500 $\mu$g/L. Using individual, self-reported data on daily consumption of rice and drinking water the total arsenic ADI was 1176 $\mu$g (range: 419 to 2053 $\mu$g), 14{\%} attributable to inorganic arsenic in cooked rice. The ADI is a conservative estimate; vegetable arsenic was not included due to limitations in self-reported daily consumption amounts. Given the arsenic levels measured in food and water and consumption of these items, cooked rice and vegetables are a substantial exposure pathway for inorganic arsenic. Intervention strategies must consider all sources of dietary arsenic intake.},

The husks of harvested, unprocessed rice are not digested by humans and need to be removed to obtain edible grains, whereas the bran can be partially (brown rice) or totally removed (white rice). Brown rice is a wholegrain cereal and, as such, is known to have beneficial effects on human health. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of whole grains can reduce the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and some types of cancer. However, white rice is preferred for reasons connected to appearance, taste, palatability, ease of cooking, tradition, safety, shelf-life, and lack of awareness about its benefits and availability. In this review, the latest scientific reports regarding the nutritional composition of brown rice and the evolution of the technology for its production will be briefly reviewed together with research on nutritional implications of brown rice consumption also in relation to cancer development in humans. A specific chapter is devoted to pigmented rice which, thanks to its composition, has attracted the growing interest of consumers worldwide. The need for further studies to help promote the consumption of wholegrain rice are also discussed.},

Epidemiological studies suggest a strong association between prenatal arsenic exposure and subsequent childhood respiratory infections, as well as morbidity from respiratory diseases in adulthood, long after systemic clearance of arsenic. We investigated the impact of exclusive prenatal arsenic exposure on the inflammatory immune response and respiratory health after an adult influenza A (IAV) lung infection. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 100 ppb sodium arsenite in utero, and subsequently infected with IAV (H1N1) after maturation to adulthood. Assessment of lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at various time points post IAV infection reveals greater lung damage and inflammation in arsenic exposed mice versus control mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of immune cells harvested from IAV infected lungs suggests that the enhanced inflammatory response is mediated by dysregulation of innate immune function of monocyte derived macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, and alveolar macrophages. Our results suggest that prenatal arsenic exposure results in lasting effects on the adult host innate immune response to IAV infection, long after exposure to arsenic, leading to greater immunopathology. This study provides the first direct evidence that exclusive prenatal exposure to arsenic in drinking water causes predisposition to a hyperinflammatory response to IAV infection in adult mice, which is associated with significant lung damage.},

@article{Jomova2011a,
	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid element that is present in air, water and soil. Inorganic arsenic tends to be more toxic than organic arsenic. Examples of methylated organic arsenicals include monomethylarsonic acid [MMA(V)] and dimethylarsinic acid [DMA(V)]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage is a common denominator in arsenic pathogenesis. In addition, arsenic induces morphological changes in the integrity of mitochondria. Cascade mechanisms of free radical formation derived from the superoxide radical, combined with glutathione-depleting agents, increase the sensitivity of cells to arsenic toxicity. When both humans and animals are exposed to arsenic, they experience an increased formation of ROS/RNS, including peroxyl radicals (ROO), the superoxide radical, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical (OH) via the Fenton reaction, hydrogen peroxide, the dimethylarsenic radical, the dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical and/or oxidant-induced DNA damage. Arsenic induces the formation of oxidized lipids which in turn generate several bioactive molecules (ROS, peroxides and isoprostanes), of which aldehydes [malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-nonenal (HNE)] are the major end products. This review discusses aspects of chronic and acute exposures of arsenic in the etiology of cancer, cardiovascular disease (hypertension and atherosclerosis), neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances, liver disease and renal disease, reproductive health effects, dermal changes and other health disorders. The role of antioxidant defence systems against arsenic toxicity is also discussed. Consideration is given to the role of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E ($\alpha$-tocopherol), curcumin, glutathione and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in their protective roles against arsenic-induced oxidative stress. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Therefore, this study evaluated the association between low to moderate arsenic exposure and T2DM. In 2009-2011, we conducted a study of 957 Bangladeshi adults who participated in a case-control study of skin lesions in 2001-2003. The odds ratio of T2DM was evaluated in relationship to arsenic exposure measured in drinking water and in subjects' toenails (in 2001-2003) prior to the diagnosis of T2DM (in 2009-2011). Compared with those exposed to the lowest quartile of arsenic in water (≤ 1.7 µg/L), the adjusted odds ratio for T2DM was 1.92 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 4.35) for those in the second quartile, 3.07 (95{\%} CI: 1.38, 6.85) for those in the third quartile, and 4.51 (95{\%} CI: 2.01, 10.09) for those in the fourth quartile. The relative excess risk of T2DM was 4.78 for individuals who smoked and 8.93 for people who had a body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) greater than 25. These findings suggest that exposure to modest levels of arsenic in drinking water was associated with increased risk of T2DM in Bangladesh. Being overweight or smoking was also associated with increased risk of T2DM.},

	abstract = {This study reports an evaluation on the quality of drinking waters: 37 bottled water samples available in the market and 15 tap water samples supplied by municipal pipelines. Water samples were analyzed for 57 dissolved inorganic components. Considering the Italian and WHO guidelines for drinking water, results show an ample compliance with respect to the toxic elements Cr, Cd, Hg and Pb. In 20{\%} of the bottled water samples, one or more components have been found at concentrations exceeding the Italian regulations (Cl-, SO4
2-, NO3
- limit for infants, F-, As) and the WHO guidelines (B, U). These bottled waters are natural mineral waters, sometimes containing trace elements at concentrations significantly higher than those normally accepted in drinking water. With reference to the studied components, the overall quality of the investigated bottled waters does not appear to be always superior when compared with the municipal tap waters. Results indicate the need to update the current guidelines for drinking waters (including bottled waters) on the basis of epidemiological studies capable of assessing the toxicity related to long-term exposure to toxic and harmful trace elements. The mineral waters with excess concentrations of harmful elements should clearly report on the label the maximum daily uptake based on the lowest health risk exposure. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a potent environmental pollutant that has caused one of the largest public health poisonings in the history of human civilization, affecting tens of millions of people worldwide especially in Bangladesh. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in blood plays an important role in predicting cell or organ damage and as an important clue to the diagnosis of a variety of cancers. However, effect of chronic arsenic exposure on the LDH level in blood has not yet been documented. Since the chronic arsenic exposure is associated with organ damages and multi-site cancers, this research aimed at assaying the plasma level of LDH activity in the population who were exposed to arsenic chronically in Bangladesh. A total of 185 individuals living in arsenic-exposed areas and 121 individuals living in non-exposed area in Bangladesh were recruited as study subjects. Arsenic content in drinking water, hair and nails were estimated by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and LDH activity was assayed by a spectrophotometer. Significant increase in LDH activity was observed with increasing concentrations of arsenic in water, hair and nails. Further, the study subjects were split into four groups based on the three ways of each exposure metrics (water, hair and nail arsenic concentrations) where the study subjects in the non-exposed area were used as a reference (lowest exposure) group. LDH activity was found to be increased in the higher exposure groups of water and hair arsenic concentrations. LDH activity was also increased at low to medium exposure groups of nail arsenic concentrations.Thus, the elevated plasma LDH activity might be helpful for the early prognosis of organ or tissue damage in the individuals who were exposed to arsenic chronically. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is naturally associated with gold mineralisation and elevated in some soils and mine waste around historical gold mining activity in Victoria, Australia. To explore uptake, arsenic concentrations in children's toenail clippings and household soils were measured, and the microdistribution and speciation of arsenic in situ in toenail clipping thin sections investigated using synchrotron-based X-ray microprobe techniques. The ability to differentiate exogenous arsenic was explored by investigating surface contamination on cleaned clippings using depth profiling, and direct diffusion of arsenic into incubated clippings. Total arsenic concentrations ranged from 0.15 to 2.1$\mu$g/g (n=29) in clipping samples and from 3.3 to 130$\mu$g/g (n=22) in household soils, with significant correlation between transformed arsenic concentrations (Pearson's r=0.42, P=0.023) when household soil was treated as independent. In clipping thin sections (n=2), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) mapping showed discrete layering of arsenic consistent with nail structure, and irregular arsenic incorporation along the nail growth axis. Arsenic concentrations were heterogeneous at 10×10$\mu$m microprobe spot locations investigated ({\textless}0.1 to 13.3$\mu$g/g). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra suggested the presence of two distinct arsenic species: a lower oxidation state species, possibly with mixed sulphur and methyl coordination (denoted As{\~{}}III(-S, -CH3)); and a higher oxidation state species (denoted As{\~{}}V(-O)). Depth profiling suggested that surface contamination was unlikely (n=4), and XRF and XANES analyses of thin sections of clippings incubated in dry or wet mine waste, or untreated, suggested direct diffusion of arsenic occurred under moist conditions. These findings suggest that arsenic in soil contributes to some systemic absorption associated with periodic exposures among children resident in areas of historic gold mining activity in Victoria, Australia. Future studies are required to ascertain if adverse health effects are associated with current levels of arsenic uptake. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Approximately 35 million people in Bangladesh are chronically exposed to inorganic arsenic (InAs) in drinking water. Methylation of InAs to monomethylarsonic (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acids (DMA) relies on folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary arsenic (uAs) elimination. OBJECTIVES We examined the relationships between folate, cobalamin, cysteine, total homocysteine (tHcys), and uAs metabolites in a sample of 6-year-old Bangladeshi children (n = 165). METHODS Children provided blood samples for measurement of tHcys, folate, cobalamin, and cysteine, and urine specimens for the measurement of total uAs and As metabolites. RESULTS Consistent with our studies in adults, mean tHcys concentrations (7.9 micromol/L) were higher than those reported among children of similar ages in other populations. Nineteen percent of the children had plasma folate concentrations {\textless} 9.0 nmol/L. The proportion of total uAs excreted as InAs ({\%}InAs) was inversely correlated with folate (r = -0.20, p = 0.01) and cysteine (r = -0.23, p = 0.003), whereas the correlations between {\%}DMA and both folate (r = 0.12, p = 0.14) and cysteine (r = 0.11, p = 0.15) were positive. Homocysteine was inversely correlated (r = -0.27, p = 0.009) with {\%}MMA in males, and the correlation with {\%}DMA was positive (r = 0.13, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that, similar to adults, folate and cysteine facilitate As methylation in children. However, the inverse correlation between tHcys and {\%}MMA, and positive correlation with {\%}DMA, are both opposite to our previous findings in adults. We propose that upregulation of one-carbon metabolism, presumably necessary to meet the considerable demands for DNA and protein biosynthesis during periods of rapid growth, results in both increased tHcys biosynthesis and increased As methylation.},

Methods: The participants (834 non-smoking adult males) were subdivided in two groups: an arsenic-exposed group (n = 446, mean age 35.3 years) drinking arsenic-contaminated groundwater (11-50 $\mu$g/L) and a control group of 388 age-matched men drinking water containing {\textless}10 $\mu$g/L of arsenic. Arsenic in water samples was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was documented by structured, validated questionnaire. Pulmonary function test (PFT) was assessed by portable spirometer. Results: Compared with control, the arsenic-exposed subjects had higher prevalence of upper and lower respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, asthma, eye irritation and headache. Besides, 20.6 {\%} of arsenic-exposed subjects had lung function deficits (predominantly restrictive and combined types) compared with 13.6 {\%} of control (p {\textless} 0.05). A positive association was observed between arsenic concentration in drinking water and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, while a negative association existed between arsenic level and spirometric parameters. Conclusions: The findings suggest that even low-level arsenic exposure has deleterious respiratory effects. {\textcopyright} 2014 Swiss School of Public Health.},

@article{Breton2021,
	abstract = {Interest in understanding the health effects of chemical mixtures has grown over the past two decades, as evidenced by the acceleration in human health studies across all life stages and increased funding for exposomics research. In parallel, interest in health effects specific to complex mixtures of metals and trace elements has grown. Unique to the consideration of metals and trace elements, perhaps, is the recognition that not all metals are toxic and that, for some elements, there may be optimal levels at which they are beneficial, above and below which they are not. Studying these complexities in relation to health outcomes necessitates biological understanding of the metals and elements at play. It also requires statistical methodologies that can simultaneously investigate nonlinear associations and interactions between metals and elements whose combined effects may be in opposite directions. In recent years, statistical methods have emerged to address some of these needs, as there is general recognition that the field of environmental epidemiology must move beyond a single-pollutant modeling framework (Keil et al. 2021; Tanner et al. 2020). Zhang et al. (2021) report that prenatal exposure to the trace elements selenium (Se) and manganese (Mn) was associated with lower systolic blood pressure in children of ages 3-15 y, whereas exposure to the metals lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) was not associated with either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The authors used newer statistical methodology-Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) (Bobb et al. 2015, 2018)-to evaluate both nonlinear associations and interactions between metals and trace elements. In so doing, they found an interaction between Cd and Mn. Although Mn was associated overall with lower blood pressure, this apparent protective effect was stronger in mothers with higher Cd concentrations, as measured in red blood cells collected shortly after delivery. Consistent with the findings for joint exposure to Cd and Mn, the association between Mn and systolic blood pressure differed by maternal smoking, a primary source of Cd (Zhang et al. 2021). Specifically, increasing Mn was associated with lower blood pressure among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy, but it was not associated with blood pressure in children whose mothers did not smoke. Therefore, the authors suggest that Mn supplementation during pregnancy for mothers who smoke may help protect their children from risk of developing high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. However, systolic blood pressure was higher in children of mothers who smoked regardless of their Mn level. The suggestion for nutritional intervention raises an important consideration and avenue for future exploration, although the public health message to not smoke during pregnancy should remain a primary focus. As more evidence emerges showing interactions between trace elements and metals in pregnancy, should we more seriously consider targeted use of essential elements in populations with known high exposures to potentially toxic metals? Might nutritional intervention mitigate risk? We have certainly known for decades that nutritional status can affect the toxicity of some pollutants (Mahaffey and Vanderveen 1979). Other examples of interactions between trace elements and metals related to a variety of child health outcomes also are beginning to emerge (Howe et al. 2020a, 2020b, 2021; Liu et al. 2018). However, in many of these cases, the results suggest that the positive association between the trace element and these outcomes may be attenuated at higher levels of the toxic metal. In such cases, the benefit of potential nutritional intervention is less clear. Hopefully, as the field matures, as we understand the non-linear relationships between metals and trace elements, and as we apply more sophisticated methodologies to tease apart these complexities , greater clarity will emerge. The work by Zhang et al. also highlights the potential contribution of metal exposures to adverse cardiovascular health at an early age. In adults, toxic metal exposures are known to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk, even at relatively low levels of exposure (Bulka et al. 2019; Lee et al. 2016; Oliver-Williams et al. 2018; Shiue and Hristova 2014; Wu et al. 2018). Although studies of individual metals have begun to reveal similar relationships among children and adolescents, only a handful of studies have explored associations between metal mixtures and childhood blood pressure, and their results have largely disagreed with one another (Howe et al. 2021; Kupsco et al. 2019; Shih et al. 2021). These disparate results highlight the complexities of mixtures analyses. It is highly likely that the composition of mixtures will vary by population, study context, and timing of exposure assessment, making comparability across studies a challenge. For these very reasons, though, it remains incredibly important to conduct such studies in diverse settings. The Zhang et al. study was conducted in the Boston Birth Cohort, a large (n = 1,194), diverse prospective birth cohort. This study, which focuses on a racially diverse, low-income population of children, provides unique insight into the impacts of metal mixtures exposures on child health in an urban context, which has not been adequately explored in prior studies. Nonetheless, one important limitation is the lack of exposure data throughout the entire pregnancy. The investigators' use of red blood cells at delivery reflects third-trimester exposures but misses any potentially important windows of susceptibility in early pregnancy. Another limitation is the lack of information on childhood metal exposure, which could mediate or be independently associated with childhood blood pressure. Indeed, there is evidence that postnatal exposures can sometimes be more strongly related to blood pressure than prenatal exposures (Farzan et al. 2021).},

	abstract = {Concerns have recently been raised about the presence of metals in apple juices. As such, the concentration of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), mercury (Hg), and zinc (Zn) were measured in six commercially available brands of apple juice and three organic brands. The concentrations of total As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, and Zn in all nine apple juice brands sampled were below each metal's respective U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maximum contaminant level for bottled water. However, in some apple juices the levels of Al, Pb, and Mn exceeded FDA maximum contaminant levels for bottled water. Therefore, a screening level risk assessment was carried out to assess the potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks that may result from metal exposure via apple juice consumption. Changes in blood Pb concentrations were also estimated to characterize potential risk from Pb exposure. Our results suggest that the exposure concentrations of the studied metals do not pose an increased non-carcinogenic risk (Hazard Index. {\textless}. 1). Incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) resulting from apple juice consumption was also estimated using both the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) and the U.S. EPA cancer slope factor for inorganic As. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {During 1998-2000, the authors investigated relations between lung function, respiratory symptoms, and arsenic in drinking water among 287 study participants, including 132 with arsenic-caused skin lesions, in West Bengal, India. The source population involved 7,683 participants who had been surveyed for arsenic-related skin lesions in 1995-1996. Respiratory symptoms were increased among men with arsenic-caused skin lesions (versus those without lesions), particularly "shortness of breath at night" (odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.1, 7.6) and "morning cough" (OR = 2.8, 95{\%} CI: 1.2, 6.6) in smokers and "shortness of breath ever" (OR = 3.8, 95{\%} CI: 0.7, 20.6) in nonsmokers. Among men with skin lesions, the average adjusted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was reduced by 256.2 ml (95{\%} CI: 113.9, 398.4; p {\textless} 0.001) and the average adjusted forced vital capacity (FVC) was reduced by 287.8 ml (95{\%} CI: 134.9, 440.8; p {\textless} 0.001). In men, a 100-$\mu$g/liter increase in arsenic level was associated with a 45.0-ml decrease (95{\%} CI: 6.2, 83.9) in FEV1 (p = 0.02) and a 41.4-ml decrease (95{\%} CI: -0.7, 83.5) in FVC (p = 0.054). Women had lower risks than men of developing skin lesions and showed little evidence of respiratory effects. In this study, consumption of arsenic-contaminated water was associated with respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function in men, especially among those with arsenic-related skin lesions.

	abstract = {Rice is a major source of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the human diet because paddy rice is efficient at accumulating As. Rice As speciation is dominated by iAs and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Here we review the global pattern in rice As speciation and the factors causing the variation. Rice produced in Asia shows a strong linear relationship between iAs and total As concentration with a slope of 0.78. Rice produced in Europe and the United States shows a more variable, but generally hyperbolic relationship with DMA being predominant in U.S. rice. Although there is significant genotypic variation in grain As speciation, the regional variations are primarily attributed to environmental factors. Emerging evidence also indicates that methylated As species in rice are derived from the soil, while rice plants lack the As methylation ability. Soil flooding and additions of organic matter increase microbial methylation of As, although the microbial community responsible for methylation is poorly understood. Compared with iAs, methylated As species are taken up by rice roots less efficiently but are transported to the grain much more efficiently, which may be an important factor responsible for the spikelet sterility disorder (straight-head disease) in rice. DMA is a weak carcinogen, but the level of ingestion from rice consumption is much lower than that of concern. Questions that require further investigations are identified.},

An emerging body of evidence suggests that exposure to inorganic As may be associated with nonmalignant respiratory disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between As exposure at levels seen in the United States and prevalence of asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and respiratory symptoms.Urinary As was collected from 5365 participants from the combined 2003.2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts. Two methods to adjust for organic As component were incorporated into the statistical model. Linear and logistic regression models compared urinary As adjusted for organic As with diagnoses of obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory symptoms.Geometric mean concentration of urinary As were not significantly different between participants with and those without asthma, chronic bronchitis,and emphysema. Odds of having asthma was 0.71for participants with the highest quintile of urinary As (≥17.23 $\mu$g/dl) when compared to the lowest quintile (≤3.52 $\mu$g/dl). A significant association was found between increasing urinary As concentration and decreasing age, male gender, and non-"white" race.A significant association between urinary As and obstructive pulmonary disease and symptoms was not demonstrated in the U.S. population. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

@article{Coetzee2016,
	abstract = {Background: Children's exposure to manganese (Mn) is a public health concern and consistent policy guidelines for safe levels of Mn exposure is lacking. The complexity of establishing exposure thresholds for Mn partially relates to its dual role as an essential micronutrient with low levels required for good health, but also as a neurotoxin at high levels. Questions exist about the age-related susceptibility to excess Mn, particularly for children, and how best to measure chronic exposures. To address this concern we conducted a systematic review of studies examining children's exposure to Mn and neurodevelopmental outcomes focused on selection of biomarker-based and environmental measurements of Mn exposure to identify the scientific advances and research gaps. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through March 2016 for studies that were published in English, used a biomarker-based or environmental measurement of Mn exposure, and measured at least one neurological outcome for children aged 0--18 years. Ultimately, thirty-six papers from 13 countries were selected. Study designs were cross-sectional (24), prospective cohorts (9), and case control (3). Neurodevelopmental outcomes were first assessed for Mn exposure in infants (6 papers), toddlers or preschoolers (3 papers) and school-age children (27 papers). Results: Studies of school-aged children most frequently measured Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores using Mn biomarkers of hair or blood. Higher hair concentrations of Mn were consistently associated with lower IQ scores while studies of blood biomarkers and IQ scores had inconsistent findings. Studies of infants and toddlers most frequently measured mental and psychomotor development; findings were inconsistent across biomarkers of Mn (hair, cord blood, tooth enamel, maternal or child blood and dentin). Although few studies measured environmental sources of Mn, hair biomarkers were associated with Mn in drinking water and infant formula. Only one paper quantified the associations between environmental sources of Mn and blood concentrations. Conclusion: Hair-Mn was the more consistent and valid biomarker of Mn exposure in school-aged children. Accurate measurement of children's exposure to Mn is crucial for addressing these knowledge gaps in future studies. However, research on biomarkers feasible for fetuses and infants is urgently needed given their unique vulnerability to excessive Mn},

	abstract = {Exposure assessment for elemental components of particulate matter (PM) using land use modeling is a complex problem due to the high spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations at the local scale. Land use regression (LUR) models may fail to capture complex interactions and non-linear relationships between pollutant concentrations and land use variables. The increasing availability of big spatial data and machine learning methods present an opportunity for improvement in PM exposure assessment models. In this manuscript, our objective was to develop a novel land use random forest (LURF) model and compare its accuracy and precision to a LUR model for elemental components of PM in the urban city of Cincinnati, Ohio. PM smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and eleven elemental components were measured at 24 sampling stations from the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study (CCAAPS). Over 50 different predictors associated with transportation, physical features, community socioeconomic characteristics, greenspace, land cover, and emission point sources were used to construct LUR and LURF models. Cross validation was used to quantify and compare model performance. LURF and LUR models were created for aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), and total PM2.5 in the CCAAPS study area. LURF utilized a more diverse and greater number of predictors than LUR and LURF models for Al, K, Mn, Pb, Si, Zn, TRAP, and PM2.5 all showed a decrease in fractional predictive error of at least 5{\%} compared to their LUR models. LURF models for Al, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Pb, Si, Zn, TRAP, and PM2.5 all had a cross validated fractional predictive error less than 30{\%}. Furthermore, LUR models showed a differential exposure assessment bias and had a higher prediction error variance. Random forest and other machine learning methods may provide more accurate exposure assessment.},

	abstract = {Because of the lack of data on the exposure to and toxic effects of inorganic arsenic during early human development, the transfer of arsenic to the fetus and suckling infant was studied in a native Andean population, living in the village San Antonio de los Cobres in the North west of Argentina, where the drinking water contains about 200 micrograms/liter. The concentration of arsenic in cord blood (median, 9 micrograms/liter) was almost as high as in maternal blood (median, 11 micrograms/liter), and there was a significant correlation between the two. Thus, at least in late gestation, arsenic is easily transferred to the fetus. The median concentration of arsenic in the placenta was 34 micrograms/kg, compared with 7 micrograms/kg previously reported for nonexposed women. Interestingly, essentially all arsenic in the blood plasma of both the newborns and their mothers was in the form of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), the end product of inorganic arsenic metabolism. Similarly, about 90{\%} of the arsenic in the urine of both the newborns and mothers in late gestation was present as DMA, compared with about 70{\%} in nonpregnant women (p {\textless} 0.001). This may indicate that methylation of arsenic is increased during pregnancy and that DMA is the major form of arsenic transferred to the fetus. The increased methylation in late gestation was associated with lower arsenic concentrations in blood and higher concentrations in urine, compared with a few months postpartum. The arsenic concentrations in the urine of the infants decreased from about 80 micrograms/liter during the first 2 days of life to less than 30 micrograms/liter at 4.4 months (p = 0.025). This could be explained by the low concentrations of arsenic in the breast milk, about 3 micrograms/kg.},

Recent evidence suggests that exposure to Mn from drinking water could be neurotoxic; however, research is hampered by the lack of consensus on a reliable biomarker of Mn exposure. Naturally high concentrations of Mn can occur in groundwater, particularly for private, unregulated water systems. This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to Mn from drinking water with a relatively low Mn content (median of 2.9 $\mu$g/L; range, undetectable--8,340 $\mu$g/L) and Mn in toenails from women collected at two time points: during and after pregnancy. Mn concentrations in the paired toenail samples gathered during the second to third trimester of pregnancy and 2 weeks postpartum were correlated (r = 0.47, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 596). Among women consuming drinking water Mn in the highest tertile (i.e., {\textgreater} 9.8 $\mu$g/L) significant positive correlations were found between water Mn and toenails Mn (r = 0.31 and r = 0.38, for toenail samples collected during pregnancy and postpartum, respectively), whereas little to no correlation was observed at lower water concentrations. Overall, our data suggest that maternal toenail samples are a reliable environmental Mn exposure biomarker and reflect exposure from drinking water.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe breastfeeding practices and investigate the influence of exclusive breastfeeding in early infancy on the risk of infant deaths, especially those attributable to respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on a birth cohort of 1677 infants who were born in slum areas of Dhaka in Bangladesh and followed from birth to 12 months of age. After enrollment at birth, the infants were visited 5 more times by 12 months of age. Verbal autopsy, based on a structured questionnaire, was used to assign a cause to the 180 reported deaths. Proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of breastfeeding practices, introduced as a time-varying variable, after accounting for other variables, including birth weight. Overall neonatal, postneonatal and infant mortality, and mortality attributable to ARI and diarrhea were measured. RESULTS: The proportion of infants who were breastfed exclusively was only 6{\%} at enrollment, increasing to 53{\%} at 1 month and then gradually declining to 5{\%} at 6 months of age. Predominant breastfeeding declined from 66{\%} at enrollment to 4{\%} at 12 months of age. Very few infants were not breastfed, whereas the proportion of partially breastfed infants increased with age. Breastfeeding practices did not differ between low and normal birth weight infants at any age. The overall infant mortality rate was 114 deaths per 1000 live births. Compared with exclusive breastfeeding in the first few months of life, partial or no breastfeeding was associated with a 2.23-fold higher risk of infant deaths resulting from all causes and 2.40- and 3.94-fold higher risk of deaths attributable to ARI and diarrhea, respectively. CONCLUSION: The important role of appropriate breastfeeding practices in the survival of infants is clear from this analysis. The reduction of ARI deaths underscores the broad-based beneficial effect of exclusive breastfeeding in prevention of infectious diseases beyond its role in reducing exposure to contaminated food, which may have contributed to the strong protection against diarrhea deaths.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wide range of neuropsychological development outcomes in children are currently measured in a large number of birth cohort and child cohort studies. METHODS: We summarized neuropsychological development assessment protocols from a number of birth cohort studies, reviews and specific books on child neuropsychology into a unifying conceptual framework. RESULTS: We suggest that neuropsychological development can be differentiated into two levels, i.e. functional and clinical. The functional level includes the skills, abilities, capacities and knowledge acquired during maturation of the brain as a result of the development of neural networks. It can be further divided into cognitive, psychomotor and social-emotional development subdomains. The clinical level includes the assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders or the presence of symptoms (subclinical symptomatology) of these disorders in populations under investigation in environmental epidemiology studies. CONCLUSIONS: Through explicit recognition of these levels of outcomes, and in using this framework, epidemiologists will be better able to design research through the informed selection of individual levels of outcomes. The framework also serves to standardize disparate terminologies across this field and allows for pooling of epidemiological data on neuropsychological endpoints where essentially similar levels of outcomes have been analyzed using different tests.},

	abstract = {Background: Few studies have evaluated the association between low-level arsenic (As) exposure and cognitive performance among children. Objectives: In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the association between low-level As exposure and cognitive performance among 5--8 year-old children in Montevideo, and tested effect modification by As methylation capacity and children's dietary folate intake. Methods: We measured total urinary As (UAs) concentrations and the proportion of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) in the urine of 328 children. Seven subtests of the standardized Woodcock-Mu{\~{n}}oz cognitive battery were used to assess cognitive performance, from which, the general intellectual abilities (GIA) score was derived. Total folate intake was estimated from two 24-h dietary recalls. Linear regression analyses were performed. Effect modification was assessed by stratifying at the median {\%}MMA value and tertiles of total folate intake calculated as micrograms (µg) of dietary folate equivalents (dfe). Results: The median UAs was 11.9 µg/l (range = 1.4--93.9), mean folate intake was 337.4 (SD = 123.3) µg dfe, and median {\%}MMA was 9.42 (range = 2.6--24.8). There was no association between UAs and cognitive abilities, and no consistent effect modification by {\%}MMA. UAs was associated inversely with concept formation, and positively with cognitive efficiency and numbers reversed subtest in the lowest folate intake tertile; UAs was also positively associated with sound integration in the second tertile and concept formation in the highest tertile of folate intake. There was no consistent pattern of effect modification by {\%}MMA or folate intake. Conclusion: There was no association between low-level As exposure and general cognitive abilities.},

Generation of oxidative stress may contribute to arsenic carcinogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: To investigate the association between arsenic exposure and oxidative stress, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was evaluated in a cohort of 97 women recruited from an arsenic-endemic region of Bangladesh in 2003. Arsenic exposure was measured in urine, toenails, and drinking water. Drinking water and urine samples were collected on three consecutive days. Susceptibility to oxidative stress was evaluated by genotyping relevant polymorphisms in glutathione-s transferase mu (GSTM1), human 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) genes using the Taqman method. Data were analyzed using random effects Tobit regression to account for repeated measures and 8-OHdG values below the detection limit.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A consistent negative effect for APE1 was observed across water, toenail and urinary arsenic models. APE1 148 glu/glu + asp/glu genotype was associated with a decrease in logged 8-OHdG of 0.40 (95{\%}CI -0.73, -0.07) compared to APE1 148 asp/asp. An association between total urinary arsenic and 8-OHdG was observed among women with the GSTM1 null genotype but not in women with GSTM1 positive. Among women with GSTM1 null, a comparison of the second, third, and fourth quartiles of total urinary arsenic to the first quartile resulted in a 0.84 increase (95{\%} CI 0.27, 1.42), a 0.98 increase (95{\%} CI 033, 1.66) and a 0.85 increase (95{\%} CI 0.27, 1.44) in logged 8-OHdG, respectively. No effects between 8-OHdG and toenail arsenic or drinking water arsenic were observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results suggest the APE1 variant genotype decreases repair of 8-OHdG and that arsenic exposure is associated with oxidative stress in women who lack a functional GSTM1 detoxification enzyme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Investigators measuring exposure biomarkers in urine typically adjust for creatinine to account for dilution-dependent sample variation in urine concentrations. Similarly, it is standard to adjust for serum lipids when measuring lipophilic chemicals in serum. However, there is controversy regarding the best approach, and existing methods may not effectively correct for measurement error. OBJECTIVES We compared adjustment methods, including novel approaches, using simulated case-control data. METHODS Using a directed acyclic graph framework, we defined six causal scenarios for epidemiologic studies of environmental chemicals measured in urine or serum. The scenarios include variables known to influence creatinine (e.g., age and hydration) or serum lipid levels (e.g., body mass index and recent fat intake). Over a range of true effect sizes, we analyzed each scenario using seven adjustment approaches and estimated the corresponding bias and confidence interval coverage across 1,000 simulated studies. RESULTS For urinary biomarker measurements, our novel method, which incorporates both covariate-adjusted standardization and the inclusion of creatinine as a covariate in the regression model, had low bias and possessed 95{\%} confidence interval coverage of nearly 95{\%} for most simulated scenarios. For serum biomarker measurements, a similar approach involving standardization plus serum lipid level adjustment generally performed well. CONCLUSIONS To control measurement error bias caused by variations in serum lipids or by urinary diluteness, we recommend improved methods for standardizing exposure concentrations across individuals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Oral exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) is associated with adverse health effects. Epidemiological studies suggest differences in susceptibility to these health effects, possibly due to genotypic variation. Genetic polymorphisms in iAs metabolism could lead to increased susceptibility by altering urinary iAs metabolite concentrations. OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of genotypic polymorphisms on iAs metabolism. METHODS We screened 360 publications from PubMed and Web of Science for data on urinary mono- and dimethylated arsenic (MMA and DMA) percentages and polymorphic genes encoding proteins that are hypothesized to play roles in arsenic metabolism. The genes we examined were arsenic (+3) methyltransferase (AS3MT), glutathione-s-transferase omega (GSTO), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). Relevant data were pooled to determine which polymorphisms are associated across studies with changes in urinary metabolite concentration. RESULTS In our review, AS3MT polymorphisms rs3740390, rs11191439, and rs11191453 were associated with statistically significant changes in percent urinary MMA. Studies of GSTO polymorphisms did not indicate statistically significant associations with methylation, and there are insufficient data on PNP polymorphisms to evaluate their impact on metabolism. DISCUSSION Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that AS3MT polymorphisms alter in vivo metabolite concentrations. Preliminary evidence suggests that AS3MT genetic polymorphisms may impact disease susceptibility. GSTO polymorphisms were not associated with iAs-associated health outcomes. Additional data are needed to evaluate the association between PNP polymorphisms and iAs-associated health outcomes. Delineation of these relationships may inform iAs mode(s) of action and the approach for evaluating low-dose health effects for iAs. CONCLUSIONS Genotype impacts urinary iAs metabolite concentrations and may be a potential mechanism for iAs-related disease susceptibility.},

	abstract = {Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age. Methods: Data from 1842 children participating in the GINIplus German birth cohort who underwent spirometry at age 15 were analysed. PWV was calculated from weight measurements obtained between birth and two years of age. Generalised additive models were fitted after adjustment for potential confounding factors (birth weight, height, and age at lung function testing). Results are presented per interquartile range increase (3.5 kg/year) in PWV. Results: PWV was negatively associated with pre-bronchodilation flow rates after extensive adjustment for potential confounders including asthma: forced expiratory flow at 50{\%} of forced vital capacity (FEF50) decreased by 141 ml/s (95{\%}CI = [-225;-57]), FEF75 by 84 ml/s [-144;-24] and FEF25-75 by 118 ml/s [-192;-44]. FEV1/FVC was also negatively associated with PWV (-0.750{\%} [-1.273;-0.226]) whereas forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not. Similar results were found for measurements post-bronchodilation. Conclusion: Early life weight gain was negatively associated with flow indices in adolescence, suggesting structural changes in peripheral lungs.},

	abstract = {Arsenic is a ubiquitous metalloid present at low concentrations in rocks, soil and natural ground water. A total of 103 773 food samples (including drinking water) were used to calculate dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs). Of these, 101 020 were based on total arsenic (tAs) and 2 753 on iAs. Among the reported results on tAs, 66.1 {\%} were below the limit of detection or quantification (left-censored); for the reported data on iAs the percentage of left-censored data was 41.9 {\%}. Most of the data (92.5 {\%}) reported as tAs were converted to iAs using different approaches before calculating dietary exposure to iAs. The EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database was used to estimate chronic dietary exposure to iAs using 28 surveys from 17 European countries. According to the scenarios used for the treatment of left-censored data, mean dietary exposure among infants, toddlers and other children ranged from 0.20 to 1.37 $\mu$g/kg b.w. per day, while the 95th percentile dietary exposure estimates ranged from 0.36 to 2.09 $\mu$g/kg b.w. per day. Mean dietary exposure among the adult population (including adults, elderly and very elderly) ranged from 0.09 to 0.38 $\mu$g/kg b.w. per day, and 95th percentile dietary exposure estimates ranged from 0.14 to 0.64 $\mu$g/kg b.w. per day. For all the age classes except infants and toddlers, the main contributor to dietary exposure to iAs was the food group `Grain-based processed products (non rice-based)', in particular, wheat bread and rolls. Other food groups that were important contributors to iAs exposure were rice, milk and dairy products (main contributor in infants and toddlers), and drinking water. The most important sources of uncertainty in the present assessment are related to the heterogeneity of the food consumption data, the conversion of tAs into iAs and to the treatment of the left-censored data.},

	abstract = {In populations exposed to heavy metals, there are few biomarkers that capture intermediate exposure windows. We sought to determine the correlation between toenail metal concentrations and prior 12-month work activity in welders with variable, metal-rich, welding fume exposures. Forty-eight participants, recruited through a local union, provided 69 sets of toenail clippings. Union-supplied and worker-verified personal work histories were used to quantify hours welded and respirator use. Toenail samples were digested and analyzed for lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and arsenic (As) using ICP-MS. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to examine the correlation between toenail metal concentrations. Using mixed models to account for multiple participation times, we divided hours welded into three-month intervals and examined how weld hours correlated with log-transformed toenail Pb, Mn, Cd, Ni, and As concentrations. Highest concentrations were found for Ni, followed by Mn, Pb and As, and Cd. All the metals were significantly correlated with one another (rho range = 0.28-0.51), with the exception of Ni and As (rho = 0.20, p = 0.17). Using mixed models adjusted for age, respirator use, smoking status, and BMI, we found that Mn was associated with weld hours 7-9 months prior to clipping (p = 0.003), Pb was associated with weld hours 10-12 months prior to clipping (p = 0.03) and over the entire year (p = 0.04). Cd was associated with weld hours 10-12 months prior to clipping (p = 0.05), and also with the previous year's total hours welded (p = 0.02). The association between Ni and weld hours 7-9 months prior to clipping approached significance (p = 0.06). Toenail metal concentrations were not associated with the long-term exposure metric, years as a welder. Results suggest Mn, Pb, and Cd may have particular windows of relevant exposure that reflect work activity. In a population with variable exposure, toenails may serve as useful biomarkers for occupational metal fume exposures to Mn, Pb, and Cd during distinct periods over the year prior to sample collection.},

	abstract = {Children living near contaminated mining waste areas may have high exposures to metals from the environment. This study investigates whether exposure to arsenic and lead is higher in children in a community near a legacy mine and smelter site in Arizona compared to children in other parts of the United States and the relationship of that exposure to the site. Arsenic and lead were measured in residential soil, house dust, tap water, urine, and toenail samples from 70 children in 34 households up to 7 miles from the site. Soil and house dust were sieved, digested, and analyzed via ICP-MS. Tap water and urine were analyzed without digestion, while toenails were washed, digested and analyzed. Blood lead was analyzed by an independent, certified laboratory. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between each environmental media and urine and toenails for arsenic and lead. Geometric mean arsenic (standard deviation) concentrations for each matrix were: 22.1 (2.59) ppm and 12.4 (2.27) ppm for soil and house dust ({\textless}63 $\mu$m), 5.71 (6.55). ppb for tap water, 14.0 (2.01) $\mu$g/L for specific gravity-corrected total urinary arsenic, 0.543 (3.22) ppm for toenails. Soil and vacuumed dust lead concentrations were 16.9 (2.03) ppm and 21.6 (1.90) ppm. The majority of blood lead levels were below the limit of quantification. Arsenic and lead concentrations in soil and house dust decreased with distance from the site. Concentrations in soil, house dust, tap water, along with floor dust loading were significantly associated with toenail and urinary arsenic but not lead. Mixed models showed that soil and tap water best predicted urinary arsenic. In our study, despite being present in mine tailings at similar levels, internal lead exposure was not high, but arsenic exposure was of concern, particularly from soil and tap water. Naturally occurring sources may be an additional important contributor to exposures in certain legacy mining areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Careful evaluation of the quality of human observational studies (HOS) is required to assess the suitability of HOS for quantitative risk assessment (QRA). In particular, the quality of quantitative exposure assessment is a crucial aspect of HOS to be considered for QRA. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidelines for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and to apply these guidelines to case-control and cohort studies on the relation between exposure to benzene and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We developed a three-tiered framework specific for the evaluation of HOS for QRA and used it to evaluate HOS on the relation between exposure to benzene and AML. RESULTS: The developed framework consists of 20 evaluation criteria. A specific focus of the framework was on the quality of exposure assessment applied in HOS. Seven HOS on the relation of benzene and AML were eligible for evaluation. Of these studies, five were suitable for QRA and were ranked based on the quality of the study design, conduct, and reporting on the study. CONCLUSION: The developed guidelines facilitate a structured evaluation that is transparent in its application and harmonizes the evaluation of HOS for QRA. With the application of the guidelines, it was possible to identify studies suitable for QRA of benzene and AML and rank these studies based on their quality. Application of the guidelines in QRA will be a valuable addition to the assessment of the weight of evidence of HOS for QRA.},

As this shift is likely to continue, clinical scientists should be aware of the analytical aspects of ICP-MS, as well as the potential for both spectroscopic and non-spectroscopic interference, and strategies that can be employed to eliminate or mitigate these issues.},

The characteristic feature of the groundwaters are low Eh (range, -151 to -37 mV; mean, -68 mV) and nitrate (range, 0.01-1.7 mg/l; mean, 0.14 mg/l) followed by high alkalinity (range, 100-630 mg/l; mean, 301 mg/l), Fe (range, 0.99-38 mg/l; mean, 8.1 mg/l), phosphate (range, 0.01-15 mg/l; mean, 0.54 mg/l), hardness (range, 46-600 mg/l; mean, 245 mg/l) and sulphate (range, 0.19-88 mg/l; mean, 7.2 mg/l), indicating reducing nature of the aquifer. The land use pattern (sanitation, surface water bodies, sanitation coupled with surface water bodies and agricultural lands) demonstrates local enrichment factor for As/Fe in groundwater. Among these, sanitation is the most prevailing where groundwater is generally enriched with As (mean, 269 $\mu$g/l) and Fe (mean, 9.8 mg/l). Questionnaire survey highlights that ∼70{\%} of the villagers in the study area do not have proper sanitation. This demonstrating the local unsewered sanitation (organic waste, anthropogenic in origin) could also cause As toxicity in rural Bengal. In the agricultural lands, higher mean values of alkalinity, phosphate, sulphate, hardness and electrical conductivity was observed, and could be linked with the excessive use of fertilizers for agricultural production. Bio-markers study indicates that the accumulation of As in hair and nail is related with the construction of exposure scenario with time dimension. The strength and weakness of the on-going West Bengal and Bangladesh drinking water supply scenario and achievability towards alternative options are also evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is one of the most toxic and cancer-causing metals which is generally entered the food chain via intake of As contaminated water or food and harmed the life of living things especially human beings. Therefore, the reduction of As content in the food could be of great importance for healthy life. To reduce As contamination in the soil and food, the evaluation of plant-based As uptake and transportation mechanisms is critically needed. Different soil factors such as physical and chemical properties of soil, soil pH, As speciation, microbial abundance, soil phosphates, mineral nutrients, iron plaques and roots exudates effectively regulate the uptake and accumulation of As in different parts of plants. The detoxification mechanisms of As in plants depend upon aquaporins, membrane channels and different transporters that actively control the influx and efflux of As inside and outside of plant cells, respectively. The xylem loading is responsible for long-distance translocation of As and phloem loading involves in the partitioning of As into the grains. However, As detoxification mechanism based on the clear understandings of how As uptake, accumulations and translocation occur inside the plants and which factors participate to regulate these processes. Thus, in this review we emphasized the different soil factors and plant cell transporters that are critically responsible for As uptake, accumulation, translocation to different organs of plants to clearly understand the toxicity reasons in plants. This study could be helpful for further research to develop such strategies that may restrict As entry into plant cells and lead to high crop yield and safe food production.},

Design - Cross sectional analysis of parent reported birth weight, gestational age, and respiratory symptoms; parental smoking and social conditions; forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced expiratory rates between 25{\%} and 75{\%} and 75{\%} and 85{\%} (FEF25-75 and FEF75-85), and height. Setting - Primary schools in England and Scotland in 1990. Subjects - 5573 children aged 5-11 (63.3{\%} of eligible children) had respiratory symptoms analysed and 2036 children (67.1{\%} of eligible children) had lung function measured. Main outcome measures - Symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, occasional and frequent wheeze, cough first thing in the morning, and cough at any other time and lung function. Results - Birth weight adjusted for gestational age was significantly associated with all lung function measurements, except FEF25-75. The association remained for FVC (b = 0.475, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.181 to 0.769) and FEV1 (b = 0.502, 0.204 to 0.800) after adjustment for gestational age, parental smoking, and social factors. FEF75-85 was the only lung function related to gestational age. Respiratory symptoms, especially wheeze most days (adjusted odds ratio 0.9, 0.84 to 0.97) were significantly associated with prematurity. Every extra week of gestation reduced the risk of severe wheeze by about 10{\%}. Conlcusions - Lung function is affected mainly by intrauterine environment while respiratory illness, especially wheezing, in childhood is related to prematurity.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTDietary exposure of the Valencian region population to lead, cadmium, inorganic arsenic (iAs), chromium, copper, tin and methylmercury (meHg) was assessed in a total diet study carried out in the region of Valencia in 2010--11. A total of 8100 food samples were collected and analysed. Occurrence data were combined with consumption data to estimate dietary exposure in adults ({\textgreater} 15 years of age) and young children (6--15 years of age). The estimated intake was calculated by a probabilistic approach. Average intake levels (optimistic scenario) for lead, iAs, chromium and tin were 0.21, 0.08, 1.79 and 1.87 µg kg−1 bw day−1 respectively; for Cd and meHg average intake levels were 0.77 and 0.54 µg kg--1 bw week−1, respectively, and for Cu, 1.60 mg day−1. In terms of risk characterisation, the results showed that 2.84{\%} of the adult population may exceed the BMDL10 (benchmark dose lower confidence limit) established for Pb, which is linked to renal effects; whereas 28.01{\%} of the young children population may...},

	abstract = {Toenails were used recently in epidemiological and environmental health studies as a means of assessing exposure to arsenic from drinking water. While positive correlations between toenail and drinking-water arsenic concentrations were reported in the literature, a significant percentage of the variation in toenail arsenic concentration remains unexplained by drinking-water concentration alone. Here, the influence of water consumption at home and work, food intake, and drinking-water concentration on toenail arsenic concentration was investigated using data from a case-control study being conducted in 11 counties of Michigan. The results from 440 controls are presented. Log-transformed drinking-water arsenic concentration at home was a significant predictor (p {\textless} .05) of toenail arsenic concentration (R2 = .32). When arsenic intake from consumption of tap water and beverages made from tap water (microg/L arsenic x L/d = microg/d) was used as a predictor variable, the correlation was markedly increased for individuals with {\textgreater}1 microg/L arsenic (R2 = .48). Increased intake of seafood and intake of arsenic from water at work were independently and significantly associated with increased toenail arsenic concentration. However, when added to intake at home, work drinking-water exposure and food intake had little influence on the overall correlation. These results suggest that arsenic exposure from drinking-water consumption is an important determinant of toenail arsenic concentration, and therefore should be considered when validating and applying toenails as a biomarker of arsenic exposure.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Dietary exposure from food to toxic inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the general U.S. population has not been well studied. OBJECTIVES The goal of this research was to quantify dietary As exposure and analyze the major contributors to total As (tAs) and iAs. Another objective was to compare model predictions with observed data. METHODS Probabilistic exposure modeling for dietary As was conducted with the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Dietary (SHEDS-Dietary) model, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The dose modeling was conducted by combining the SHEDS-Dietary model with the MENTOR-3P (Modeling ENvironment for TOtal Risk with Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling for Populations) system. Model evaluation was conducted via comparing exposure and dose-modeling predictions against duplicate diet data and biomarker measurements, respectively, for the same individuals. RESULTS The mean modeled tAs exposure from food is 0.38 microg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times higher than the mean As exposures from the drinking water. The mean iAs exposure from food is 0.05 microg/kg/day (1.96 microg/day), which is approximately two times higher than the mean iAs exposures from the drinking water. The modeled exposure and dose estimates matched well with the duplicate diet data and measured As biomarkers. The major food contributors to iAs exposure were the following: vegetables (24{\%}); fruit juices and fruits (18{\%}); rice (17{\%}); beer and wine (12{\%}); and flour, corn, and wheat (11{\%}). Approximately 10{\%} of tAs exposure from foods is the toxic iAs form. CONCLUSIONS The general U.S. population may be exposed to tAs and iAs more from eating some foods than from drinking water. In addition, this model evaluation effort provides more confidence in the exposure assessment tools used.},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporal cancer mortality studies in Spain have revealed patterns for some tumours which display a distribution that is similar across the sexes and persists over time. Such characteristics would be common to tumours that shared risk factors, including the chemical soil composition. The objective of the present study is to assess the association between levels of chromium and arsenic in soil and the cancer mortality. This is an ecological cancer mortality study at municipal level, covering 861,440 cancer deaths in 7917 Spanish mainland towns from 1999 to 2008. Chromium and arsenic topsoil levels (partial extraction) were determined by ICP-MS at 13,317 sampling points. To estimate the effect of these concentrations on mortality, we fitted Besag, York and Molli{\'{e}} models, which included, as explanatory variables, each town's chromium and arsenic soil levels, estimated by kriging. In addition, we also fitted geostatistical-spatial models including sample locations and town centroids (non-aligned data), using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE). All results were adjusted for socio-demographic variables and proximity to industrial emissions. The results showed a statistical association in men and women alike, between arsenic soil levels and mortality due to cancers of the stomach, pancreas, lung and brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Among men, an association was observed with cancers of the prostate, buccal cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, colorectal and kidney. Chromium topsoil levels were associated with mortality among women alone, in cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, breast and NHL. Our results suggest that chronic exposure arising from low levels of arsenic and chromium in topsoil could be a potential risk factor for developing cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Adherence to a Mediterranean diet may improve longevity, but relevant data are limited. METHODS We conducted a population-based, prospective investigation involving 22,043 adults in Greece who completed an extensive, validated, food-frequency questionnaire at base line. Adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet was assessed by a 10-point Mediterranean-diet scale that incorporated the salient characteristics of this diet (range of scores, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating greater adherence). We used proportional-hazards regression to assess the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total mortality, as well as mortality due to coronary heart disease and mortality due to cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index, physical-activity level, and other potential confounders. RESULTS During a median of 44 months of follow-up, there were 275 deaths. A higher degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a reduction in total mortality (adjusted hazard ratio for death associated with a two-point increment in the Mediterranean-diet score, 0.75 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.87]). An inverse association with greater adherence to this diet was evident for both death due to coronary heart disease (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.67 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.47 to 0.94]) and death due to cancer (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.98]). Associations between individual food groups contributing to the Mediterranean-diet score and total mortality were generally not significant. CONCLUSIONS Greater adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet is associated with a significant reduction in total mortality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic (As) exposure has been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and with biomarkers of potential CVD risk and inflammatory processes. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of As on such biomarkers in U.S. populations, which are typically exposed to low to moderate As concentrations.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated associations between As exposures and biomarkers relevant to inflammation, oxidative stress, and CVD risk in a subset of participants from the New Hampshire Health Study, a population with low to moderate As exposure (n=418).
METHODS: Associations between toenail As, total urine As (uAs), and {\%}uAs metabolites [monomethyl ({\%}uMMAV), dimethyl ({\%}uDMAV), and inorganic ({\%}iAs) species] and plasma biomarkers, including soluble plasma vascular and cellular adhesion molecules (VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, respectively), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and urinary oxidative stress marker 15-F2t-isoprostane (15-F2t-IsoP), were evaluated using linear regression models.
RESULTS: Covariate-adjusted estimates of associations with a doubling of urinary As suggested an 8.8{\%} increase in 15-F2t-IsoP (95{\%} CI: 3.2, 14.7), and a doubling of toenail As was associated with a 1.7{\%} increase in VCAM-1 (95{\%} CI: 0.2, 3.2). Additionally, a 5{\%} increase in {\%}uMMA was associated with a 7.9{\%} increase in 15-F2t-IsoP (95{\%} CI: 2.1, 14.1), and a 5{\%} increase in {\%}uDMA was associated with a 2.98{\%} decrease in 15-F2t-IsoP [(95{\%} CI: -6.1, 0.21); p=0.07]. However, in contrast with expectations, a doubling of toenail As was associated with a 2.3{\%} decrease (95{\%} CI: -4.3, -0.3) in MMP-9, and a 5{\%} increase in {\%}uMMA was associated with a 7.7{\%} decrease (95{\%} CI: -12.6, -2.5) in PAI-1.
CONCLUSION: In a cross-sectional study of U.S. adults, we observed some positive associations of uAs and toenail As concentrations with biomarkers potentially relevant to CVD pathogenesis and inflammation, and evidence of a higher capacity to metabolize inorganic As was negatively associated with a marker of oxidative stress. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2062.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) finds its way into soils used for rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation through polluted irrigation water, and through historic contamination with As-based pesticides. As is known to be present as a number of chemical species in such soils, so we wished to investigate how these species were accumulated by rice. As species found in soil solution from a greenhouse experiment where rice was irrigated with arsenate contaminated water were arsenite, arsenate, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid. The short-term uptake kinetics for these four As species were determined in 7-d-old excised rice roots. High-affinity uptake (0-0.0532 mM) for arsenite and arsenate with eight rice varieties, covering two growing seasons, rice var. Boro (dry season) and rice var. Aman (wet season), showed that uptake of both arsenite and arsenate by Boro varieties was less than that of Aman varieties. Arsenite uptake was active, and was taken up at approximately the same rate as arsenate. Greater uptake of arsenite, compared with arsenate, was found at higher substrate concentration (low-affinity uptake system). Competitive inhibition of uptake with phosphate showed that arsenite and arsenate were taken up by different uptake systems because arsenate uptake was strongly suppressed in the presence of phosphate, whereas arsenite transport was not affected by phosphate. At a slow rate, there was a hyperbolic uptake of monomethylarsonic acid, and limited uptake of dimethylarsinic acid.},

We compared nutrient and food intakes from FFQs estimated for two periods of pregnancy (reproducibility), and compared energy-adjusted intake of several carotenoids, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C and $\alpha$-tocopherol of the FFQ in the first trimester with their concentration in blood specimens (validity).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Significant correlations for reproducibility were found for major food groups and nutrients but not for lycopene (r=0.06); the average correlation coefficients for daily intake were 0.51 for food groups and 0.61 for nutrients. For validity, statistically significant correlations were observed for vitamin C (0.18), $\alpha$-carotene (0.32), $\beta$-carotene (0.22), lutein-zeaxantin (0.29) and $\beta$-cryptoxantin(0.26); non-significant correlations were observed for retinol, lycopene, $\alpha$-tocopherol, vitamin B12 and folate (r≤0.12). When dietary supplement use was considered, correlations were substantially improved for folate (0.53) and to a lesser extent for vitamin B12 (0.12) and vitamin C (0.20).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study supports that the FFQ has a good reproducibility for nutrient and food intake, and can provide a valid estimate of several important nutrients during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Background: Urinary metallomics is presented here as a new "omics" approach that aims to facilitate personalized cancer screening and prevention by improving our understanding of urinary metals in disease. Methods: Twenty-two urinary metals were examined with inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in 138 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and benign conditions. Urinary metals from spot urine samples were adjusted to renal dilution using urine specific gravity. Results: Two urinary metals, copper (P-value = 0.036) and lead (P-value = 0.003), were significantly increased in the urine of breast cancer patients. A multivariate model that comprised copper, lead, and patient age afforded encouraging discriminatory power (AUC: 0.728, P-value {\textless} 0.0005), while univariate models of copper (61.7{\%} sensitivity, 50.0{\%} specificity) and lead (76.6{\%} sensitivity, 51.2{\%} specificity) at optimized cutoff thresholds compared favorably with other breast cancer diagnostic modalities such as mammography. Correlations found among various metals suggested potential geographic and dietary influences on the urine metallome that warrant further investigation. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept work introduces urinary metallomics as a noninvasive, potentially transformative "omics" approach to early cancer detection. Urinary copper and lead have also been preliminarily identified as potential breast cancer biomarkers.},

	abstract = {An extensive data set of total arsenic analysis for 901 polished (white) grain samples, originating from 10 countries from 4 continents, was compiled. The samples represented the baseline (i.e., notspecifically collected from arsenic contaminated areas), and all were for market sale in major conurbations. Median total arsenic contents of rice varied 7-fold, with Egypt (0.04 mg/kg) and India (0.07 mg/kg) having the lowest arsenic content while the U.S. (0.25 mg/kg) and France (0.28 mg/kg) had the highest content. Global distribution of total arsenic in rice was modeled by weighting each country's arsenic distribution by that country's contribution to global production. A subset of 63 samples from Bangladesh, China, India, Italy, and the U.S. was analyzed for arsenic species. The relationship between inorganic arsenic contentversus total arsenic contentsignificantly differed among countries, with Bangladesh and India having the steepest slope in linear regression, and the U.S. having the shallowest slope. Using country-specific rice consumption data, daily intake of inorganic arsenic was estimated and the associated internal cancer risk was calculated using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cancer slope. Median excess internal cancer risks posed by inorganic arsenic ranged 30-fold for the 5 countries examined, being 0.7 per 10,000 for Italians to 22 per 10,000 for Bangladeshis, when a 60 kg person was considered.},

The first step prior to a risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals is problem formulation defining the relevant exposure, hazard and population to be considered. In practice, risk assessment of multiple chemicals is conducted using a tiered approach for exposure assessment, hazard assessment and risk characterisation. Higher tiers require increasing knowledge about the group of chemicals under assessment and the tiers can range from tier 0 (default values, data poor situation) to tier 3 (full probabilistic models). This scientific report reviews the terminology, methodologies and frameworks developed by national and international agencies for the human risk assessment of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and provides recommendations for future activities at EFSA in this area.},

	abstract = {Background: Consistent evidence at high levels of water arsenic (≥100 mg/l), and growing evidence at low-moderate levels ( {\textless} 100 mg/l), support a link with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The shape of the dose-response across low-moderate and high levels of arsenic in drinking water is uncertain and critical for risk assessment. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of general population epidemiological studies of arsenic and incident clinical CVD (all CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke) with three or more exposure categories. In a dose-response meta-analysis, we estimated the pooled association between log-transformed water arsenic (log-linear) and restricted cubic splines of log-transformed water arsenic (non-linear) and the relative risk of each CVD endpoint. Results: Twelve studies (pooled N=408 945) conducted at high (N=7) and lowmoderate (N=5) levels of water arsenic met inclusion criteria, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with 10 mg/l, the estimated pooled relative risks [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] for 20 mg/l water arsenic, based on a log-linear model, were 1.09 (1.03, 1.14) (N=2) for CVD incidence, 1.07 (1.01, 1.14) (N=6) for CVD mortality, 1.11 (1.05, 1.17) (N=4) for CHD incidence, 1.16 (1.07, 1.26) (N=6) for CHD mortality, 1.08 (0.99, 1.17) (N=2) for stroke incidence and 1.06 (0.93, 1.20) (N=6) for stroke mortality. We found no evidence of non-linearity, although these tests had low statistical power. Conclusions: Although limited by the small number of studies, this analysis supports quantitatively including CVD in inorganic arsenic risk assessment, and strengthens the evidence for an association between arsenic and CVD across low-moderate to high levels.},

@article{Cubadda2015,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Latium (central Italy), arsenic concentrations exceeding the regulatory limit of 10 mug/L for drinking water are present in groundwater from a large area of volcanic origin. At least in part of the area, high arsenic concentrations have been detected also in soil and phytoavailable geogenic arsenic enters the food chain. As a result, local population may be exposed to inorganic arsenic via water and also through consumption of food with higher than background arsenic concentrations. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted to assess inorganic arsenic exposure and metabolism in 269 residents of 27 municipalities in the provinces of Viterbo, Rome and Latina. Total arsenic in toenails and the sum of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites in urine, the latter determined by HPLC-ICP-MS, were used as biomarkers of inorganic arsenic exposure. All the subjects involved in the study provided samples of the water(s) used for drinking and cooking as well as detailed information on water use. To get an insight into dietary intake from locally-processed food, inorganic arsenic in bread samples collected in affected municipalities of the three provinces was determined and compared to background levels of samples from reference areas. RESULTS: 30{\%} of the sample used bottled water or resorted to water treatment in order to lower the arsenic content {\textless}10 mug/L (Group 1), 51{\%} of the sample drank bottled water and used tap water with an arsenic content exceeding 10 mug/L for cooking only (Group 2), 19{\%} of the sample used tap water with an arsenic content exceeding 10 mug/L for both drinking and cooking (Group 3). Nail arsenic was higher for Group 2 and 3 compared to Group 1, whereas all groups had higher nail arsenic than the reference group. The sum of inorganic arsenic and related metabolites in urine was higher in Group 3 than in the other two groups, and higher in Group 2 compared to Group 1. White bread from the study area showed significantly higher inorganic arsenic levels compared to samples from reference areas. CONCLUSIONS: Use of toenail arsenic as biomarker of long-term exposure allowed to retrospectively reconstruct exposure irrespective of recent modifications due to changes in water use. In Group 3, urinary concentration of inorganic arsenic and metabolites exceeded the upper limit of the reference concentration range for the Italian population. Inter-individual variability of the efficiency of arsenic metabolism in the study population was substantial indicating that a subgroup of the population is more susceptible to the toxic effects of inorganic arsenic owing to a lower methylation capability.},

Mean IQ level in the contaminated area varies between 76 and 120 and two-sample t test results show significance difference (p {\textless} 0.000) with control. The multiple regression analysis suggests strong negative regression coefficient (−308.2) of IQ with water borne arsenic (WAs). Almost similar negative regression coefficient (−6.513) is also recorded with memory power. Results also suggest the inconsistency with urine arsenic and drinking water arsenic. On the other hand, drinking water manganese level also demonstrates weak relation with IQ.},

@article{Watanabe2013,
	abstract = {Arsenic is a worldwide environmental pollutant and a human carcinogen. It is well recognized that the toxicity of arsenicals largely depends on the oxidoreduction states (trivalent or pentavalent) and methylation levels (monomethyl, dimethyl, and trimethyl) that are present during the process of metabolism in mammals. However, presently, the specifics of the metabolic pathway of inorganic arsenicals have yet to be confirmed. In mammals, there are two possible mechanisms that have been proposed for the metabolic pathway of inorganic arsenicals, oxidative methylation, and glutathione conjugation. Oxidative methylation, which was originally proposed in fungi, is based on findings that arsenite (iAs(III)) is sequentially converted to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) in both humans and in laboratory animals such as mice and rats. However, recent in vitro observations have demonstrated that arsenic is only methylated in the presence of glutathione (GSH) or other thiol compounds, which strongly suggests that arsenic is methylated in trivalent forms. The glutathione conjugation mechanism is supported by findings that have shown that most intracellular arsenicals are trivalent and excreted from cells as GSH conjugates. Since non-conjugated trivalent arsenicals are highly reactive with thiol compounds and are easily converted to less toxic corresponding pentavalent arsenicals, the arsenic-glutathione conjugate stability may be the most important factor for determining the toxicity of arsenicals. In addition, "being a non-anionic form" also appears to be a determinant of the toxicity of oxo-arsenicals or thioarsenicals. The present review discusses both the metabolism of arsenic and the toxicity of arsenic metabolites.},

	abstract = {Background: Chronic arsenic exposure is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. Prolongation of the QT (time between initial deflection of QRS complex to the end of T wave) interval and profound repolarization changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) have been reported in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with arsenic trioxide. This acquired form of long QT syndrome can result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of arsenic by investigating QT interval alterations in a human population chronically exposed to arsenic. Methods: Residents in Ba Men, Inner Mongolia, have been chronically exposed to arsenic via consumption of water from artesian wells. A total of 313 Ba Men residents with the mean arsenic exposure of 15 years were divided into three arsenic exposure groups: low (≤ 21 $\mu$g/L), medium (100-300 $\mu$g/L), and high (430-690 $\mu$g/L). ECGs were obtained on all study subjects. The normal range for QTc (corrected QT) interval is 0.33-0.44 sec, and QTc ≥ 0.45 see was considered to be prolonged. Results: The prevalence rates of QT prolongation and water arsenic concentrations showed a dose-dependent relationship (p = 0.001). The prevalence rates of QTc prolongation were 3.9, 11.1, 20.6{\%} for low, medium, and high arsenic exposure, respectively. QTc prolongation was also associated with sex (p {\textless} 0.0001) but not age (p = 0.486) or smoking (p = 0.1018). Females were more susceptible to QT prolongation than males. Conclusions: We found significant association between chronic arsenic exposure and QT interval prolongation in a human population. QT interval may potentially be useful in the detection of early cardiac arsenic toxicity.},

	abstract = {Background: Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is ubiquitous in the environment and has been linked to lung cancer and a number of non-malignant lung disease in both adults and children. However, most studies were conducted in populations with higher arsenic exposure levels in drinking water and relatively little epidemiologic research evaluated the impacts of low levels iAs exposure on non-malignant lung disease among populations that are not primarily exposed to arsenic through drinking water. Objectives: We assessed the associations of arsenic exposure with airway inflammation and lung function among U.S. adults aged 20--79 years using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007--2012 cycles. Methods: Two measures of arsenic exposure, urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsonic acid (DMA), were used. We calibrated these two exposure measures by regressing their concentrations by arsenobetaine and extracting the residuals to calculate estimated total arsenic and estimated DMA. Arsenic exposures were modeled as log-transformed continuous variables as well as quartile categories. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), an indicator of respiratory inflammation, was available for participants. For lung function, the best forced expiratory volume in the first one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate (FEF) 25--75{\%}, their percent estimated values, ratios of FEV1 to FVC, and FEF 25--75{\%} to FVC were used (i.e. FEV1/FVC and FEF/FVC). Weighted multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to evaluate the association of arsenic exposure with airway inflammation and lung function overall, and among males and females. Results: Significant associations between arsenic exposure and increased airway inflammation were found. A two-fold increase in urinary total arsenic and DMA was associated with 23.87{\%} (95{\%} CI: 2.66, 49.46) and 14.05{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.77, 27.81) higher levels of FENO, respectively. In addition, participants in the highest quartile of urinary total arsenic had FENO levels 8.49{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.13, 16.39) higher than those in the lowest quartile. These associations were similar between males and females. Limited evidence was found for the association with respect to lung function and potential modification effect of sex. Conclusions: Arsenic exposure was related to increased risk of airway inflammation but there is limited evidence of an association in relation to lung function. Future research conducted in populations with relatively lower exposure levels that are not primarily exposed to arsenic through drinking water is needed to confirm our findings.},

Rinse washing was effective at removing circa. 10{\%} of the total and inorganic arsenic from basmati rice, but was less effective for other rice types. While steaming reduced total and inorganic arsenic rice content, it did not do so consistently across all rice types investigated. Low volume water cooking did not remove arsenic.

The samples studied included walnuts, Brazil nuts, Macadamia nuts, pecans, hazelnuts, chestnuts, cashews, peanuts, pistachios and seeds (almond, pine, pumpkin and sunflower). Metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry in dialyzates and also in samples after a microwave assisted acid digestion pre-treatment. Low dialyzability percentages were found for Al, Fe and Hg; moderate percentages were found for Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Pb, Se, Sr, Tl and Zn; and high dialyzability ratios were found for As, Cr and Ni. The highest dialyzability percentages were found in raw chestnuts and raw hazelnuts. Metal dialyzability was found to be negatively affected by fat content. Positive correlation was found between carbohydrate content and metal dialyzability ratios. Protein and dietary fibre content did not influence metal bioavailability. Predicted dialyzability for some metals based on fat and protein content could also be established.},

	abstract = {Background As population lead levels decrease, the toxic effects of lead may be distributed to more sensitive populations, such as infants with poor fetal growth. Objectives To determine the association of prenatal lead exposure and fetal growth; and to evaluate whether infants with poor fetal growth are more susceptible to lead toxicity than those with normal fetal growth. Methods We examined the association of second trimester maternal blood lead levels (BLL) with birthweight-for-gestational age (BWGA) z-score in 944 mother-infant participants of the PROGRESS cohort. We determined the association between maternal BLL and BWGA z-score by using both linear and quantile regression. We estimated odds ratios for small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants between maternal BLL quartiles using logistic regression. Maternal age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, parity, household smoking exposure, hemoglobin levels, and infant sex were included as confounders. Results While linear regression showed a negative association between maternal BLL and BWGA z-score ($\beta$ = − 0.06 z-score units per log2BLL increase; 95{\%} CI: − 0.13, 0.003; P = 0.06), quantile regression revealed larger magnitudes of this association in the {\textless} 30th percentiles of BWGA z-score ($\beta$ range [− 0.08, − 0.13] z-score units per log2BLL increase; all P values {\textless} 0.05). Mothers in the highest BLL quartile had an odds ratio of 1.62 (95{\%} CI: 0.99--2.65) for having a SGA infant compared to the lowest BLL quartile. Conclusions While both linear and quantile regression showed a negative association between prenatal lead exposure and birthweight, quantile regression revealed that smaller infants may represent a more susceptible subpopulation.},

	abstract = {Background Early life events can affect health in later life. We hypothesised that low lung function (FEV1 {\textless}80{\%} predicted) in early adulthood (25--40 years) is associated with higher prevalence and earlier incidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities, and premature death. Methods In this cohort analysis, we tested this hypothesis using data from the Framingham Offspring Cohort (FOC) and validated our observations in CARDIA (an independent cohort) and GenIII (which includes the direct descendants of FOC participants). These were three general population cohorts that included men and women, who were regularly and prospectively followed up to collect extensive clinical, physiological, biological, and imaging information. Main outcomes were prevalence (in early adulthood) and incidence (during follow-up) of comorbidity, and all-cause mortality. $\chi$2 test, unpaired t test, Fisher's exact test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used for data analysis. Differential dropout rates during follow-up were regarded as a potential source of bias. Findings We found that 111 (10{\%}) of 1161 participants in FOC, 338 (13{\%}) of 2648 participants in CARDIA, and 71 (4{\%}) of 1912 participants in GenIII had FEV1 of less than 80{\%} predicted at the age of 25--40 years. These individuals also had higher prevalence of respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic abnormalities in early adulthood; higher and earlier (about a decade) incidence of comorbidities during follow-up (39 years vs 47 years in FOC; 30 years vs 37 years in CARDIA, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001); and higher all-cause mortality than individuals with normal lung function in early adulthood (in FOC, hazard ratio 2{\textperiodcentered}3 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}4--3{\textperiodcentered}7], p=0{\textperiodcentered}001), which was independent of, but additive with, cumulative smoking exposure. In GenIII, we observed that individuals with at least one parent stratified as having low lung function in early adulthood in FOC (n=115) had lower FEV1 in early adulthood (10{\%} had FEV1 of less than 80{\%} predicted; this proportion was 3{\%} in those with both parents classified as normal in FOC [n=248]; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001); and early adulthood FEV1 of GenIII participants was related (R2=0{\textperiodcentered}28, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) to FOC parents' average FEV1 in early adulthood. Interpretation Low peak lung function in early adulthood is common in the general population and could identify a group of individuals at risk of early comorbidities and premature death.

The aim of our study is to explore the effects of soil available phosphorus on As uptake by rice, and identify the effects of soil properties on arsenic transfer from soil to rice under actual field conditions. 56 pairs of topsoil and rice samples were collected. The relevant parameters in soil and the inorganic arsenic in rice grains were analyzed, and then all the results were treated by statistical methods. Results show that the main factors influencing the uptake by rice grain include soil pH and available phosphorus. The eventual impact of phosphorus is identified as the suppression of As uptake by rice grains. The competition for transporters from soil to roots between arsenic and phosphorus in rhizosphere soil has been a dominant feature. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This oversight impacted, in minor way, our linear and non-linear published dose-response models for combined fatal and non-fatal strokes. The oversight does not impact, in any way, any of our other published [2] dose-response models. We corrected both Table 1 and Supplementary Materials Table S1; the exposure media for Tsinovoi et al.

Urinary DMA and MMA were positively associated with urinary arsenobetaine, suggesting direct exposure to these species in seafood or metabolism of organic arsenicals to these species, although the biomonitoring data do not directly identify the sources of exposure. The magnitude of association was much larger for DMA than for MMA. The secondary methylation index (SMI, ratio of urinary DMA to MMA) observed in the NHANES program likewise is much higher in persons with detected arsenobetaine than in those without, again suggesting that direct DMA exposure is co-occurring with exposure to arsenobetaine. Urinary MMA was less correlated with organic arsenic exposures than DMA and, therefore, may be a more reliable biomarker for iAs exposure in the general US population. However, given the associations between both MMA and DMA and organic arsenic species in urine, interpretations of the urinary arsenic concentrations observed in the NHANES in the context of potential arsenic exposure should be made cautiously. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

@article{Torrente2013,
	abstract = {For more than 100 years, an electrochemical plant has been operating in Flix (Catalonia, Spain) by the Ebro River. Its activities have originated a severe accumulation of environmental contaminants (metals, organochlorinated pesticides and radionuclides) in sediments of the Flix reservoir, while mercury (Hg) has been also frequently released to the air. Environmental exposure to industrial pollutants has been associated with decreased intelligence and behavioral problems. In the present study, we assessed, in 53 children living in the village of Flix and the surroundings, the relationships between the concentrations of a number of trace elements (As, Be, Cd, Cs, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sn, Tl, U and V) in hair and the levels of testosterone in blood, with respect to potential neuropsychological alterations. Lead (Pb) and Hg showed the highest mean concentrations in hair samples. However, the current Hg levels were lower than those previously found in children living in the same zone, while the concentration of the remaining elements was similar to those reported in the scientific literature. The outcomes of certain neuropsychological indicators showed a significant correlation with metals, such as Pb and uranium (U). More specifically, these elements were negatively correlated with working memory and hit reaction time, suggesting impulsivity. In summary, although Pb and U concentrations in hair were within standard levels, both metals could be correlated with certain, but minor, neuropsychological alterations in the childhood population of Flix. These findings should be confirmed by future birth cohort studies, with bigger study populations and using more complex statistical analyses, focused on human exposure to these specific elements.},

Confirmed incident fatal and nonfatal CHD events were analyzed according to Mediterranean diet adherence, measured by using an 18-unit relative Mediterranean diet score. A total of 609 participants (79{\%} male) had a fatal or nonfatal confirmed acute myocardial infarction (n = 468) or unstable angina requiring revascularization (n = 141). After stratification by center and age and adjustment for recognized CHD risk factors, high compared with low relative Mediterranean diet score was associated with a significant reduction in CHD risk (hazard ratio = 0.60, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.47, 0.77). A 1-unit increase in relative Mediterranean diet score was associated with a 6{\%} reduced risk of CHD (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.91, 0.97), with similar risk reductions by sex. Mediterranean diet adherence was associated with a significantly reduced CHD risk in this Mediterranean country, supporting its role in primary prevention of CHD in healthy populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous research found that infants who were exposed to high levels of arsenic in utero had an increased risk of infectious disease in the first year of life. This prospective study examined the association between arsenic exposures during gestation, and respiratory, diarrheal, and febrile morbidity in children 4-5 years of age. METHODS: A cohort of pregnant women was recruited in 2008-2011 in Bangladesh. Their children (N = 989) were followed, and household drinking water samples were collected during pregnancy, toddlerhood (12-40 months of age), and childhood (4-5 years of age). We actively surveyed mothers every 2 weeks regarding their children's infectious diseases symptoms from 4 to 5 years of age. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the association between arsenic exposure and respiratory and febrile illness. RESULTS: Median drinking water arsenic was 4.6, 8.8, and 4.2 µg/L in pregnancy, toddlerhood, and childhood, respectively. We observed 0.01, 1.2, and 1.0 cases per 100 person-days of diarrhea, respiratory, and febrile illness, respectively. The incident rate ratios (IRRs) for each doubling of drinking water arsenic during pregnancy were 1.10 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 1.22) and 0.93 (95{\%} CI = 0.82, 1.05) for respiratory and febrile illness, respectively, after adjusting for covariates. The association between arsenic exposure measured during toddlerhood and childhood was attenuated and not significantly associated with either outcome. Diarrheal disease was too infrequent to assess. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking water arsenic exposure during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of acute respiratory infections in children 4-5 years old in Bangladesh.},

Freeze-dried samples were extracted by methanol and water mixture (8:2 v/v) with a high-speed Soxhlet system; the concentration of arsenobetaine (AsB), dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMAA), arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)) in the extract were then determined using HPLC-ICPMS. The method for determining arsenobetaine concentration was confirmed using standard reference material (SRM) of BCR 627 (tuna fish) and DORM-2 (dogfish muscle) recovery rates were 95 and 90{\%}, respectively. The arsenic compounds in 60 market-ready fish muscle samples were investigated. The predominant arsenic compound found in samples was AsB. Arsenate was detected in low concentrations (ranged in 0.02-0.34 mg/kg As (fresh weight), whereas DMAA, MMAA and arsenite content were undetectable. Average AsB content in cephalopods, small fish and large fish were 5.42, 1.57 and 1.54 mg/kg As (fresh weight), respectively. The weekly intake of As was calculated based oil the consumption of fish by Taiwanese residents. The calculated results demonstrated that the intake is 30.6 mu g/kg (total As) body weight/week, higher than the acceptable weekly intake of 15 mu g/kg body weight/week for inorganic arsenic that was Suggested by WHO. However, around 87{\%} of As in fish muscle was AsB. AsB is non-toxic and non-carcinogenic to humans, and is rapidly excreted after ingestion. Therefore, intake of fish muscle is low risk based oil investigation results.},

	abstract = {Prenatal exposure to trace metals, whether they are essential, non-essential, or toxic, must be assessed for their potential health effects in the offspring. Herein is reported an approach to this end which involved collection of urine samples during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy from 489 mothers from Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain), a highly industrialized town. These samples were analyzed for cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), arsenic (As), molybdenum (Mo), cadmium (Cd), antimonium (Sb), cesium (Cs), thallium (Tl), and lead (Pb). An acid digestion method was developed and validated for inductively coupled plasma quadruple mass spectrometry (Q-ICP-MS) analysis of these 12 metals. The median concentrations of metals ranged from 0.13 to 290 $\mu$g/g creatinine, the highest levels were found for Zn and the lowest for Th. The mean concentrations of most metals except As, Ni, Th, and Pb showed statistically significant differences between both trimesters. The concentrations of Mo, Se, Cd, Cs, and Sb were higher in the first than in the third trimester, whereas the opposite was found for Co, Cu, and Zn. The concentrations of all metals in both sampling periods showed statistically significant correlations (p{\textless}0.01 for Mo and Cu, p{\textless}0.001 for the others). The significant correlations of metal urine concentrations in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy suggest that the observed differences between both periods are related to physiological changes. Accordingly, the measured urine concentrations during either the first or third trimesters can be used as estimates of exposure during pregnancy and can serve as markers for prenatal intake of these metals in the studied cohort.},

Increasing lines of evidence indicate that As may adversely affect the immune system, but its specific effects on immune function are poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a literature search of non-cancer immune-related effects associated with As exposure and summarized the known immunotoxicological effects of As in humans, animals and in vitro models. Overall, the data show that chronic exposure to As has the potential to impair vital immune responses which could lead to increased risk of infections and chronic diseases, including various cancers. Although animal and in vitro models provide some insight into potential mechanisms of the As-related immunotoxicity observed in human populations, further investigation, particularly in humans, is needed to better understand the relationship between As exposure and the development of disease.},

All specimens were analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis with a sensitivity of approximately 0.001 parts per million (ppm). Trace concentrations of arsenic were detected in 15 of the 21 well water samples and in all toenail clipping samples. Among the 10 individuals who lived in areas with reportedly high arsenic levels in the water supply, the geometric mean toenail concentration was 0.39 ppm (SE, 0.12 ppm); among the other 11 persons, the geometric mean was 0.14 ppm (SE, 0.02 ppm; P = 0.005 for the difference between the two means). The overall Spearman correlation between toenail and well water arsenic was 0.67 (P = 0.009), and among those with detectable well water levels of arsenic, the Spearman correlation was 0.83 (P = 0.0001). Based on the regression analysis of those who had detectable water levels of arsenic, a 10-fold increase in well water concentrations of arsenic was reflected by about a 2-fold increase in toenail concentrations. These results indicate that concentrations of arsenic in toenails reflect use of arsenic-containing drinking water.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to inorganic arsenic (InAs) has been documented as a risk factor for lung cancer. This study examined the association between InAs exposure, its metabolism, and lung cancer occurrence. Methods: We followed 1,300 residents from an arseniasis area in Taiwan, determined urinary InAs metabolites, and identified 39 lung cancer cases. Cox proportional hazards model was performed. Results: The results demonstrated that participants with either the primary methylation index [monomethylarsonic acid (MMA)/InAs] or the secondary methylation index [dimethylarsenic acid (DMA)/MMA] lower than their respective median values were at a higher risk of lung cancer (HRs from 3.41 to 4.66) than those with high methylation capacity. The incidence density of lung cancer increased from 79.9/100,000 (year1) to 467.4/100,000 (year1) for residents with low methylation capacity and from 0 to 158.5/100,000 (year1) for residents with high methylation capacity when the arsenic exposure dose increased from 2 to 10 ppb to 200 ppb, respectively. The analyses revealed a dose-response relationship between lung cancer occurrence and increasing arsenic concentrations in drinking water as well as cumulative arsenic exposure (monotonic trend test; P {\textless} 0.05 and P {\textless} 0.05, respectively) among the residents with low methylation capacity. The relationship between arsenic exposure and lung cancer among high methylators was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Hypomethylation responses to InAs exposure may dose dependently increase lung cancer occurrence. Impact: The high-risk characteristics observed among those exposed should be considered in future preventive medicine and research on arsenic carcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Background: Reducing cadmium (Cd) exposure in Cd-polluted areas in Asia is urgently needed given the toxic effects of Cd. The short-term and long-term benefits of lowering Cd exposure are unknown because of its long half-life in the body. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether an intervention with low-Cd rice in a contaminated area of China reduced urinary Cd (UCd) levels and improved blood pressure and kidney function outcomes compared to no-intervention in consumers of high-Cd rice in the same region. Methods: 106 non-smoking subjects were divided into three treatment groups: the intervention group (replacing homegrown high-Cd rice with market low-Cd rice, n = 34), the non-intervention group (continue eating high-Cd rice, n = 36) and the control group (continued eating low-Cd rice they have been eating for years, n = 36). The intervention period lasted for almost 8 months, during which participants were visited on up to 4 occasions and UCd, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), kidney function biomarkers ($\beta$2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-$\beta$-D-glucosaminidase) were measured. Results: After 3 months, the geometric mean UCd in the intervention (Int) group decreased significantly by 0.32 $\mu$g/g (p = 0.007), while changes were not significant in the non-intervention (non-Int) group (0.13 $\mu$g/g, p = 0.95) or the control group (−0.01 $\mu$g/g, p = 0.52). UCd in the Int group remained lower than in the non-Int group but higher than in the Control group through the end of follow up. DBP in the Int group decreased significantly from 80 mm Hg at month three (p = 0.03) and stayed around 74 mm Hg for the remainder of the study. SBP also decreased in the Int group but with variations similar to those observed in the other two groups. The two kidney biomarkers showed variations without a clear pattern. Conclusion: This study suggested that UCd reflected both short-term ({\textless}3 months) and long-term Cd exposure. In addition, the low-Cd rice intervention showed initial benefits in lowering blood pressure levels, especially DBP, but not kidney biomarkers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High arsenic exposure has been related to diabetes, but at low-moderate levels the evidence is mixed. Arsenic metabolism, which is partly genetically controlled and may rely on certain B vitamins, plays a role in arsenic toxicity.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the prospective association of arsenic exposure and metabolism with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.
METHODS: We included 1,838 American Indian men and women free of diabetes (median age, 36 y). Arsenic exposure was assessed as the sum of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonate (MMA), and dimethylarsinate (DMA) urine concentrations ($\Sigma$As). Arsenic metabolism was evaluated by the proportions of iAs, MMA, and DMA over their sum (iAs{\%}, MMA{\%}, and DMA{\%}). Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) was measured at baseline and follow-up visits. Incident diabetes was evaluated at follow-up.
RESULTS: Median $\Sigma$As, iAs{\%}, MMA{\%}, and DMA{\%} was 4.4 $\mu$g/g creatinine, 9.5{\%}, 14.4{\%}, and 75.6{\%}, respectively. Over 10,327 person-years of follow-up, 252 participants developed diabetes. Median HOMA2-IR at baseline was 1.5. The fully adjusted hazard ratio [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] for incident diabetes per an interquartile range increase in $\Sigma$As was 1.57 (95{\%} CI: 1.18, 2.08) in participants without prediabetes at baseline. Arsenic metabolism was not associated with incident diabetes. $\Sigma$As was positively associated with HOMA2-IR at baseline but negatively with HOMA2-IR at follow-up. Increased MMA{\%} was associated with lower HOMA2-IR when either iAs{\%} or DMA{\%} decreased. The association of arsenic metabolism with HOMA2-IR differed by B-vitamin intake and AS3MT genetics variants.
CONCLUSIONS: Among participants without baseline prediabetes, arsenic exposure was associated with incident diabetes. Low MMA{\%} was cross-sectional and prospectively associated with higher HOMA2-IR. Research is needed to confirm possible interactions of arsenic metabolism with B vitamins and AS3MT variants on diabetes risk. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2566.},

	abstract = {In Bangladesh, irrigation of dry season rice (boro) with arsenic-contaminated groundwater is leading to increased As levels in soils and rice, and to concerns about As-induced yield reduction. Arsenic concentrations and speciation in soil porewater are strongly influenced by redox conditions, and thus by water management during rice growth. We studied the dynamics of As, Fe, P, Si, and other elements in porewater of a paddy field near Sreenagar (Munshiganj), irrigated according to local practice, in which flooding was intermittent. During early rice growth, As porewater concentrations reached up to 500 $\mu$g L(-1) and were dominated by As(III), but As release was constrained to the lower portion of the soil above the plow pan. In the later part of the season, soil conditions were oxic throughout the depth range relevant to rice roots and porewater concentrations only intermittently increased to ∼150 $\mu$g L(-1) As(V) following irrigation events. Our findings suggest that intermittent irrigation, currently advocated in Bangladesh for water-saving purposes, may be a promising means of reducing As input to paddy soils and rice plant exposure to As.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in our knowledge of arsenic carcinogenesis include the development  of rat or mouse models for all human organs in which inorganic arsenic is known to cause cancer-skin, lung, urinary bladder, liver, and kidney. Tumors can be produced from either promotion of carcinogenesis protocols (mouse skin and lungs, rat bladder, kidney, liver, and thyroid) or from complete carcinogenesis protocols (rat bladder and mouse lung). Experiments with p53(+/-) and K6/ODC transgenic mice administered dimethylarsinic acid or arsenite have shown some degree of carcinogenic, cocarcinogenic, or promotional activity in skin or bladder. At present, with the possible exception of skin, the arsenic carcinogenesis models in wild-type animals are more highly developed than in transgenic mice. Recent advances in arsenic metabolism have suggested that methylation of inorganic arsenic may be a toxification, rather than a detoxification, pathway and that trivalent methylated arsenic metabolites, particularly monomethylarsonous acid and dimethylarsinous acid, have a great deal of biological activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that these trivalent, methylated, and relatively less ionizable arsenic metabolites may be unusually capable of interacting with cellular targets such as proteins and even DNA. In risk assessment of environmental arsenic, it is important to know and to utilize both the mode of carcinogenic action and the shape of the dose-response curve at low environmental arsenic concentrations. Although much progress has been recently made in the area of arsenic's possible mode(s) of carcinogenic action, a scientific concensus has not yet been reached. In this review, nine different possible modes of action of arsenic carcinogenesis are presented and discussed-induced chromosomal abnormalities, oxidative stress, altered DNA repair, altered DNA methylation patterns, altered growth factors, enhanced cell proliferation, promotion/progression, gene amplification, and suppression of p53.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT While gluten ingestion is responsible for the signs and symptoms of celiac disease, it is not known what factors are associated with initial appearance of the disease. OBJECTIVE To examine whether the timing of gluten exposure in the infant diet was associated with the development of celiac disease autoimmunity (CDA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Prospective observational study conducted in Denver, Colo, from 1994-2004 of 1560 children at increased risk for celiac disease or type 1 diabetes, as defined by possession of either HLA-DR3 or DR4 alleles, or having a first-degree relative with type 1 diabetes. The mean follow-up was 4.8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Risk of CDA defined as being positive for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) autoantibody on 2 or more consecutive visits or being positive for tTG once and having a positive small bowel biopsy for celiac disease, by timing of introduction of gluten-containing foods into the diet. RESULTS Fifty-one children developed CDA. Findings adjusted for HLA-DR3 status indicated that children exposed to foods containing wheat, barley, or rye (gluten-containing foods) in the first 3 months of life (3 [6{\%}] CDA positive vs 40 [3{\%}] CDA negative) had a 5-fold increased risk of CDA compared with children exposed to gluten-containing foods at 4 to 6 months (12 [23{\%}] CDA positive vs 574 [38{\%}] CDA negative) (hazard ratio [HR], 5.17; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.44-18.57). Children not exposed to gluten until the seventh month or later (36 [71{\%}] CDA positive vs 895 [59{\%}] CDA negative) had a marginally increased risk of CDA compared with those exposed at 4 to 6 months (HR, 1.87; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-3.60). After restricting our case group to only the 25 CDA-positive children who had biopsy-diagnosed celiac disease, initial exposure to wheat, barley, or rye in the first 3 months (3 [12{\%}] CDA positive vs 40 [3{\%}] CDA negative) or in the seventh month or later (19 [76{\%}] CDA positive vs 912 [59{\%}] CDA negative) significantly increased risk of CDA compared with exposure at 4 to 6 months (3 [12{\%}] CDA positive vs 583 [38{\%}] CDA negative) (HR, 22.97; 95{\%} CI, 4.55-115.93; P = .001; and HR, 3.98; 95{\%} CI, 1.18-13.46; P = .04, respectively).

@article{Warton2006,
	abstract = {Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

Infants had higher urinary i-As (p-value = 0.04), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) (p-value = 0.002), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) (p-value = 0.01), and sum of arsenic species (i-As + MMA + DMA, p-value = 0.01) during weaning than while exclusively fed on a liquid diet (i.e., breast milk, formula, or a mixture of both). Among weaning infants, increased sum of urinary arsenic species was pairwise-associated with intake of rice cereal (Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.90, p-value = 0.03), fruit ($\rho$ = 0.70, p-value = 0.03), and vegetables ($\rho$ = 0.86, p-value = 0.01). Our observed increases in urinary arsenic concentrations likely indicate increased exposure to i-As during the transition to solid foods, suggests the need to minimize exposure during this critical period of development.},

@article{Wasserman2007,
	abstract = {Background: We recently reported results of a cross-sectional investigation of intellectual function in 10-year-olds in Bangladesh, who had been exposed to arsenic from drinking water in their home wells. Objectives: We present results of a similar investigation of 301 randomly selected 6-year-olds whose parents participated in our ongoing prospective study of the health effects of As exposure in 12,000 residents of Araihazar, Bangladesh. Methods: Water As and manganese concentrations of tube wells at each home were obtained by surveying all study region wells. Children and mothers were first visited at home, where the quality of home stimulation was measured, and then seen in our field clinic, where children received a medical examination wherein weight, height, and head circumference were assessed. We assessed children's intellectual function using subtests drawn from the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, version III, by summing weighted items across domains to create Verbal, Performance, Processing Speed, and Full-Scale raw scores. Children provided urine specimens for measuring urinary As and were asked to provide blood samples for blood lead measurements. Results: Exposure to As from drinking water was associated with reduced intellectual function before and after adjusting for water Mn, for blood lead levels, and for sociodemographic features known to contribute to intellectual function. With covariate adjustment, water As remained significantly negatively associated with both Performance and Processing Speed raw scores; associations were less strong than in our previously studied 10-year-olds. Conclusions: This second cross-sectional study of As exposure expands our concerns about As neurotoxicity to a younger age group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS Arsenic toxicity in adults is associated with methylation efficiency, influenced by factors such as gender, genetics and nutrition. The aim of this study was to evaluate influencing factors for arsenic metabolism in children. METHODS For 488 children (9 years), whose mothers participated in a study on arsenic exposure during pregnancy (nested into the MINIMat trial) in rural Bangladesh, we measured urinary concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs) and its metabolites methylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) by HPLC-HG-ICPMS. Methylation efficiency was assessed by relative amounts ({\%}) of the metabolites. We evaluated the impact of factors such as maternal urinary metabolite pattern, arsenic exposure, gender, socioeconomic status, season of sampling, and nutritional factors, including erythrocyte selenium (Ery-Se), and plasma folate and vitamin B12. RESULTS Children had higher {\%}DMA and lower {\%}iAs in urine compared to their mothers, unrelated to their lower exposure [median urinary arsenic (U-As) 53 vs. 78 µg/L]. Surprisingly, selenium status (Ery-Se) was strongly associated with children's arsenic methylation; an increase in Ery-Se from the 5-95(th)percentile was associated with: +1.8 percentage points (pp) for {\%}iAs (p=0.001), +1.4 pp for {\%}MMA (p=0.003) and -3.2 pp for {\%}DMA (p{\textless}0.001). Despite this, Ery-Se was positively associated with U-As (5-95(th)percentile: +41 µg/L, p=0.026). As expected, plasma folate was inversely associated with {\%}iAs (5-95(th)percentile: -1.9 pp, p=0.001) and positively associated with {\%}DMA (5-95(th)percentile: +2.2 pp, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Children methylated arsenic more efficiently than their mothers. Also influencing factors, mainly selenium and folate, differed. This warrants further research.},

@article{Kusel2007,
	abstract = {Background: Severe lower respiratory infections (LRIs) and atopic sensitization have been identified as independent risk factors for asthma. Objective: The nature of potential interactions between these risk factors was the subject of this study. Methods: A community-based cohort of 198 children at high atopic risk was followed from birth to 5 years. All episodes of acute respiratory illness in the first year were recorded and postnasal aspirates were collected for viral identification. History of wheeze and asthma was collected annually, and atopy was assessed at 6 months, 2 years, and 5 years. Results: A total of 815 episodes of acute respiratory illness were reported, and 33{\%} were LRIs. Viruses were detected in 69{\%} of aspirates, most commonly rhinoviruses (48.3{\%}) and respiratory syncytial virus (10.9{\%}). At 5 years, 28.3{\%}(n = 56) had current wheeze, and this was associated with wheezy [odds ratio (OR), 3.4 (1.2-9.7); P = .02] and/or febrile LRI [OR, 3.9 (1.4-10.5); P = .007], in particular those caused by respiratory syncytial virus or rhinoviruses [OR, 4.1 (1.3-12.6); P = .02]. Comparable findings were made for current asthma. Strikingly these associations were restricted to children who displayed early sensitization (≤2 years old) and not observed in nonatopic patients or those sensitized later. Conclusion: These data suggest viral infections interact with atopy in infancy to promote later asthma. Notably the occurrence of both of these events during this narrow developmental window is associated with maximal risk for subsequent asthma, which suggests a contribution from both classes of inflammatory insults to disease pathogenesis. Clinical implications: Protection of "high-risk" children against the effects of severe respiratory infections during infancy may represent an effective strategy for primary asthma prevention. The potential benefits of these strategies merit more careful evaluation in this age group. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma {\&} Immunology.},

	abstract = {Background: Although physical activity has many known health benefits, its association with lung function in childhood/adolescence remains unclear. We examined the association of physical-activity trajectories between 11 and 15 years with lung function at 15 years in 2266 adolescents. Methods: A population-based cohort of 14 305 singleton births alive at 1 year was recruited in the UK population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Physical activity (counts/minute and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) was assessed for 7 days using an accelerometer at 11, 13 and 15 years. We identified sex-specific physical-activity trajectories applying K-means for longitudinal data in children with at least two accelerometer measurements (n = 3584). We then estimated the sex-specific associations of these trajectories with post-bronchodilation lung-function parameters using multivariable linear-regression models (n = 2266, 45{\%} boys). Results: Fewer than 7{\%} of participants met the WHO physical-activity recommendations (i.e. daily average of at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity). Boys were substantially more active than girls. In both sexes, we identified three distinct physical-activity trajectories ('low': 39.8{\%} boys, 45.8{\%} girls; 'moderate': 42.9{\%} boys, 41.4{\%} girls; and 'high' physical activity: 17.3{\%} boys, 12.8{\%} girls). Girls in the moderate and high physical-activity trajectories had 0.11 L [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.04-0.19] and 0.15 L (95{\%} CI: 0.03-0.26) higher forced vital capacity than their less-active peers. No association was observed in boys. Conclusions: Higher childhood physical activity relates to higher lung-function levels in adolescent girls. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this association should be pursued.},

	abstract = {This review is on arsenic in agronomic systems, and covers processes that influence the entry of arsenic into the human food supply. The scope is from sources of arsenic (natural and anthropogenic) in soils, biogeochemical and rhizosphere processes that control arsenic speciation and availability, through to mechanisms of uptake by crop plants and potential mitigation strategies. This review makes a case for taking steps to prevent or limit crop uptake of arsenic, wherever possible, and to work toward a long-term solution to the presence of arsenic in agronomic systems. The past two decades have seen important advances in our understanding of how biogeochemical and physiological processes influence human exposure to soil arsenic, and this must now prompt an informed reconsideration and unification of regulations to protect the quality of agricultural and residential soils.},

	abstract = {It is common to present multiple adjusted effect estimates from a single model in a single table. For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author.},

	abstract = {Risk assessments of arsenic have focused on skin, bladder, and lung cancers and skin lesions as the sensitive cancer and non-cancer health endpoints, respectively; however, an increasing number of epidemiologic studies that can inform risk assessment have examined neurodevelopmental effects in children. We conducted a systematic review and risk assessment based on the epidemiologic literature on possible neurodevelopmental effects at lower arsenic exposures. Twenty-four cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies were identified that report on the association between low-level arsenic exposure (i.e., largely {\textless}100. $\mu$g/L of arsenic in drinking water) and neurological outcomes in children. Although the overall evidence does not consistently show a causal dose-response relationship at low doses, the most rigorously conducted studies from Bangladesh indicate possible inverse associations with cognitive function, predominantly involving concurrent arsenic exposure as measured by biomarkers (i.e., arsenic in urine or blood) and raw verbal test scores at ages 5-11 years. Issues such as non-comparability of outcome measures across studies; inaccuracies of biomarkers and other measures of inorganic arsenic exposure; potential effect modification by cultural practices; insufficient adjustment for nutritional deficiencies, maternal IQ, and other important confounders; and presence of other neurotoxicants in foreign populations limit generalizability to U.S. populations. Of the few U.S. studies available, the most rigorously conducted study did not find a consistent dose-response relationship between arsenic concentrations in tap water or toenails and decrements in IQ scores. Assuming that the strongest dose-response relationship from the most rigorous evidence from Bangladesh is generalizable to U.S. populations, possible reference doses were estimated in the range of 0.0004-0.001 mg/kg-day. These doses are higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reference dose for chronic lifetime exposure, thus indicating protectiveness of the existing value for potential neurotoxicity in children. This reference dose is undergoing revision as EPA considers various health endpoints in the reassessment of inorganic arsenic health risks.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for an infant's first 6 months of life. When compared with exclusive breastfeeding for 4 months, greater protection against gastrointestinal infection, but not respiratory tract infection, has been demonstrated for the 6-month duration. The objective of this study was to ascertain if full breastfeeding of {\textgreater} or = 6 months compared with 4 to {\textless} 6 months in the United States provides greater protection against respiratory tract infection. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, a nationally representative cross-sectional home survey conducted from 1988 to 1994, was performed. Data from 2277 children aged 6 to {\textless} 24 months, who were divided into 5 groups according to breastfeeding status, were compared. Children who required neonatal intensive care were excluded. SUDAAN software was used to account for the complex sampling design. Logistic regression adjusted for confounding factors. Outcome measures included adjusted odds of acquiring pneumonia, {\textgreater} or = 3 episodes of cold/influenza, {\textgreater} or = 3 episodes of otitis media (OM), or wheezing in the past year or acquiring first OM at {\textless} 12 months of age. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, infants who were fully breastfed for 4 to {\textless} 6 months (n = 223) were at greater risk for pneumonia than those who were fully breastfed for {\textgreater} or = 6 months (n = 136) (6.5{\%} vs 1.6{\%}). There were not statistically significant differences in {\textgreater} or = 3 episodes of cold/influenza (45{\%} vs 41{\%}), wheezing (23{\%} vs 24{\%}), {\textgreater} or = 3 episodes of OM (27{\%} vs 20{\%}), or first OM at {\textless} 12 months of age (49{\%} vs 47{\%}). Adjusting for demographic variables, childcare, and smoke exposure revealed statistically significant increased risk for both pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 4.27; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-14.35) and {\textgreater} or = 3 episodes of OM (OR: 1.95; 95{\%} CI: 1.06-3.59) in those who were fully breastfed for 4 to {\textless} 6 months compared with {\textgreater} or = 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: This nationally representative study documents increased risk of respiratory tract infection including pneumonia and recurrent OM in children who were fully breastfed for 4 vs 6 months. These findings support current recommendations that infants receive only breast milk for the first 6 months of life.},

Objective: We sought to examine the relationship between breast-feeding and later asthma and allergy outcomes by using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a large birth cohort in the United Kingdom. Methods: We used adjusted logistic regression models to evaluate the association between breast-feeding and atopy at age 7 years, bronchial responsiveness to methacholine at age 8 years, and wheeze at ages 3 and 71/2 years. Bayesian methods were used to assess the possibility of bias caused by an influence of early wheezing on the duration of breast-feeding, as well as selection bias. Results: Breast-feeding was protective for wheeze in the first 3 years of life (odds ratio [OR] of 0.80 [95{\%} CI, 0.70-0.90] for ≥6 months relative to never) but not wheeze (OR, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.79-1.22), atopy (OR, 1.12; 95{\%} CI, 0.92-1.35), or bronchial hyperresponsiveness (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 0.82-1.40) at ages 7 to 8 years. Bayesian models adjusting for the longer duration of breast-feeding among children with wheezing in early infancy produced virtually identical results. Conclusions: We did not find consistent evidence for either a deleterious effect or a protective effect of breast-feeding on later risk of allergic disease in a large prospective birth cohort of children with objective outcome measures and extensive data on potential confounders and effect modifiers. Neither reverse causation nor loss to follow-up appears to have materially biased our results. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma {\&} Immunology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arsenic is a potent pollutant that has caused an environmental catastrophe in certain parts of the world including Bangladesh where millions of people are presently at risk due to drinking water contaminated by arsenic. Chronic arsenic exposure has been scientifically shown as a cause for liver damage, cancers, neurological disorders and several other ailments. The relationship between plasma cholinesterase (PChE) activity and arsenic exposure has not yet been clearly documented. However, decreased PChE activity has been found in patients suffering liver dysfunction, heart attack, cancer metastasis and neurotoxicity. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the PChE activity in individuals exposed to arsenic via drinking water in Bangladesh.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 141 Bangladeshi residents living in arsenic endemic areas with the mean arsenic exposure of 14.10 +/- 3.27 years were selected as study subjects and split into tertile groups based on three water arsenic concentrations: low ({\textless} 129 microg/L), medium (130-264 microg/L) and high ({\textgreater} 265 microg/L). Study subjects were further sub-divided into two groups ({\textless}or=50 microg/L and {\textgreater} 50 microg/L) based on the recommended upper limit of water arsenic concentration (50 microg/L) in Bangladesh. Blood samples were collected from the study subjects by venipuncture and arsenic concentrations in drinking water, hair and nail samples were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). PChE activity was assayed by spectrophotometer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Arsenic concentrations in hair and nails were positively correlated with the arsenic levels in drinking water. Significant decreases in PChE activity were observed with increasing concentrations of arsenic in water, hair and nails. The average levels of PChE activity in low, medium and high arsenic exposure groups were also significantly different between each group. Lower levels of PChE activity were also observed in the {\textgreater} 50 microg/L group compared to the {\textless}or=50 microg/L group. Moreover, PChE activity was significantly decreased in the skin (+) symptoms group compared to those without (-).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We found a significant inverse relationship between arsenic exposure and PChE activity in a human population in Bangladesh. This research demonstrates a novel exposure-response relationship between arsenic and PChE activity which may explain one of the biological mechanisms through which arsenic exerts its neuro-and hepatotoxicity in humans.},

	abstract = {Understanding of lead toxicity has advanced substantially over the past three decades, and focus has shifted from high-dose effects in clinically symptomatic individuals to the consequences of exposure at lower doses that cause no symptoms, particularly in children and fetuses. The availability of more sensitive analytic methods has made it possible to measure lead at much lower concentrations. This advance, along with more refined epidemiological techniques and better outcome measures, has lowered the least observable effect level until it approaches zero. As a consequence, the segment of the population who are diagnosed with exposure to toxic levels has expanded. At the same time, environmental efforts, most importantly the removal of lead from gasoline, have dramatically reduced the amount of lead in the biosphere. The remaining major source of lead is older housing stock. Although the cost of lead paint abatement is measured in billions of dollars, the monetized benefits of such a Herculean task have been shown to far outweigh the costs.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the acute toxicity of different concentrations of arsenic trioxide (As2O3; ATO) on rat lungs. In total, 160 Wistar rats were randomly divided into the control, low-, medium- and high-dose groups, which were exposed to 0, 0.16, 1.60 and 16 $\mu$g/kg of ATO by intratracheal instillation, respectively. Samples were collected at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exposure and the dynamic changes indicative of acute lung toxicity were monitored. Compared with the control group, the exposure groups exhibited significant changes such as increased lung water content ratio and protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, pulmonary interstitial thickening, cell membrane edema, increased inflammatory factor concentration, JNK and P38 were significantly activated, and the degree of phosphorylation was increased. Furthermore, all the changes in the exposure groups were exposure concentration-dependent. ATO respiratory tract exposure can cause restrictive ventilatory disturbance in rats, and the degree of injury is exposure concentration-dependent.},

Biomonitoring Equivalents (BEs) are defined as the concentration or range of concentrations of a chemical or its metabolite in a biological medium (blood, urine, or other medium) that is consistent with an existing health-based exposure guideline, and are derived by integrating available data on pharmacokinetics with existing chemical risk assessments. This study reviews available health-based exposure guidance values for arsenic based on recent evaluations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and Health Canada (HC). BE values corresponding to the Reference Dose (RfD) or risk-specific doses for cancer endpoints from these agencies were derived based on kinetic data (urinary excretion) from controlled dosing studies in humans. The BE values presented here provide estimates of the sum of inorganic arsenic-derived urinary biomarkers (inorganic arsenic, monomethylated arsenic, and dimethylated arsenic). The BE associated with the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Reference Dose and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's Minimal Risk Level is 6.4$\mu$g arsenic/L urine. The BEs associated with the various cancer risk assessments are significantly lower. These BE values may be used as screening tools for evaluation of biomonitoring data for inorganic arsenic in a public health risk context. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objective - To examine whether birth weight, infant weight, and childhood respiratory infection are associated with adult lung function and death from chronic obstructive airways disease. Design - Follow up study of men born during 1911-30 whose birth weights, weights at 1 year, and childhood illnesses were recorded at the time by health visitors. Setting - Hertfordshire, England. Subjects - 5718 men born in the county during 1911-30 and a subgroup of 825 men born in the county during 1920-30 and still living there. Main outcome measures - Death from chronic obstructive airways disease, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), and respiratory symptoms. Results - 55 men died of chronic obstructive airways disease. Death rates fell with increasing birth weight and weight at 1 year. Mean FEV1 at age 59 to 70 years, adjusted for height and age, rose by 0.06 litre (95{\%} confidence interval 0.02 to 0.09) with each pound (450 g) increase in birth weight, independently of smoking habit and social class. Bronchitis or pneumonia in infancy was associated with a 0.17 litre (0.02 to 0.32) reduction in adult FEV1 and with an increased odds ratio of wheezing and persistent sputum production in adult life independently of birth weight, smoking habit, and social class. Whooping cough in infancy was associated with a 0.22 litre (0.02 to 0.42) reduction in adult FEV1. Conclusions - Lower birth weight was associated with worse adult lung function. Intrauterine influences which retard fetal weight gain may irrecoverably constrain the growth of the airways. Bronchitis, pneumonia, or whooping cough in infancy further reduced adult lung function. They also retarded infant weight gain. Consistent with this, death from chronic obstructive airways disease in adult life was associated with lower birth weight and weight at 1 year. Promoting lung growth in fetuses and infants and reducing the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in infancy may reduce the incidence of chronic obstructive airways disease in the next generation.},

	abstract = {Background Attempts have been made to use dynamic spirometry to define restrictive lung function, but the definition of a restrictive spirometric pattern (RSP) varies between studies such as BOLD and NHANES. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of RSP among adults in northern Sweden based on different definitions. Methods In 2008--2009 a general population sample aged 21--86y within the obstructive lung disease in northern Sweden (OLIN) studies was examined by structured interview and spirometry, and 726 subjects participated (71{\%} of invited). The prevalence of RSP was calculated according to three different definitions based on pre-as well as post-bronchodilator spirometry: 1) FVC {\textless} 80{\%} {\&} FEV1/FVC {\textgreater} 0.7 2) FVC {\textless} 80{\%} {\&} FEV1/FVC {\textgreater} LLN 3) FVC {\textless} LLN {\&} FEV1/FVC {\textgreater} LLN Results The three definitions yielded RSP prevalence estimates of 10.5{\%}, 11.2{\%} and 9.4{\%} respectively, when based on pre-bronchodilator values. The prevalence was lower when based on post-bronchodilator values, i.e. 7.3{\%}, 7.9{\%} and 6.6{\%}. According to definition 1 and 2, the RSP prevalence increased by age, but not according to definition 3. The overlap between the definitions was substantial. When corrected for confounding factors, manual work in industry and diabetes with obesity were independently associated with an increased risk for RSP regardless of definition. Conclusions The prevalence of RSP was 7--11{\%}. The prevalence estimates differed more depending on the choice of pre- compared to post-bronchodilator values than on the choice of RSP definition. RSP was, regardless of definition, independently associated with manual work in industry and diabetes with obesity.},

	abstract = {Early-life exposure to arsenic (As) increases risks of respiratory diseases/infections in children. However, data on the ability of the innate immune system to combat bacterial infections in the respiratory tracts of As-exposed children are scarce. To evaluate whether persistent low-dose As exposure alters innate immune function among children younger than 5 years-of-age, mothers and participating children (N = 51) that were members of the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in rural Bangladesh were recruited. Household water As, past and concurrent maternal urinary As (U-As) as well as child U-As were all measured at enrollment. In addition, U-As metabolites were evaluated. Innate immune function was examined via measures of cathelicidin LL-37 in plasma, ex vivo monocyte-derived-macrophage (MDM)-mediated killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), and serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) responses against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Cyto-/chemokines produced by isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were assayed using a Multiplex system. Multivariable linear regression analyses revealed that maternal (p {\textless} 0.01) and child (p = 0.02) U-As were positively associated with plasma LL-37 levels. Decreased MDM-mediated Spn killing (p = 0.05) and SBA responses (p = 0.02) were seen to be each associated with fractions of mono-methylarsonic acid (MMA; a U-As metabolite) in the children. In addition, U-As levels were seen to be negatively associated with PBMC formation of fractalkine and IL-7, and positively associated with that for IL-13, IL-17 and MIP-1$\alpha$. These findings suggested that early-life As exposure may disrupt the innate host defense pathway in these children. It is possible that such disruptions may have health consequences later in life.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a widely occurring environmental contaminant. To assess human exposures to As, public health officials and researchers often conduct biomonitoring. Samples of urine, hair, nails, or blood are collected from potentially exposed people and are analyzed for As compounds and their metabolites. When analyzing for As exposure, it is useful to distinguish between As species, since they differ in their origin and toxicity. Urine is the most frequently used biological medium for biomonitoring. Measuring the urinary concentration of As is useful in assessing recent exposure to As, and high-quality reference ranges are available for urinary As concentrations in the U.S. population. Biomonitoring for As in hair and nails has been used in many studies and is particularly useful in evaluating chronic exposures to As. Interpreting the health implications of As concentrations in biological samples is limited by the small number of studies that provide information on the correlation and dose-response relationship between biomonitoring test results and adverse health effects. This study discusses the advantages and limitations of biomonitoring for As in biological samples and provides illustrative case studies.},

We here studied associations of prenatal As and Cd exposures with multiple fetal size parameters measured by ultrasound in gestational week (GW) 14 and 30 in a population-based mother-child cohort in rural Bangladesh. We measured As (n= 1929) and Cd (n= 1616) in urine during pregnancy. In the longitudinal evaluation of combined exposure, urinary Cd (UCd) showed an inverted U-shaped association (turning-point 1.5 $\mu$g Cd/L) with all fetal size parameters, while UAs showed no significant association. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that associations with UCd were somewhat stronger in early gestation. Stratification indicated stronger associations between UCd and fetal size in girls than in boys, and in poorer than in richer families, while UAs was weakly associated with fetal size in boys. In conclusion, particularly Cd, but also As, appeared to influence fetal development in a sex-dependent manner. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Seafood is the main source of organic arsenic exposure (arsenobetaine, arsenosugars and arsenolipids) in the population. Arsenosugars and arsenolipids are metabolized to several species including dimethylarsinate (DMA). Objective: Evaluate the association of seafood intake with spot urine arsenic concentrations in the 2003-2006 National Health Nutrition and Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: We studied 4276 participants ???6 years. Total arsenic was measured using inductively coupled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry (ICPMS). Urine DMA and arsenobetaine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ICPMS. Results: Participants reporting seafood in the past 24-h had higher urine concentrations of total arsenic (median 24.5 vs. 7.3 ??g/L), DMA (6.0 vs. 3.5 ??g/L), arsenobetaine (10.2 vs. 0.9 ??g/L) and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine (11.0 vs. 5.5 ??g/L). Participants reporting seafood ???2/wk vs. never during the past year had 2.3 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.9, 2.7), 1.4 (1.2, 1.6), 6.0 (4.6, 7.8) and 1.7 (1.4, 2.0) times higher (p-trend {\textless}0.001) concentrations of total arsenic, DMA, arsenobetaine and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine, respectively. In participants without detectable arsenobetaine and in analyses adjusted for arsenobetaine, seafood consumption in the past year was not associated with total arsenic or DMA concentrations in urine. Conclusion: Seafood intake was a major determinant of increased urine concentrations of total arsenic, DMA, arsenobetaine and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine in the US population. Epidemiologic studies that use total arsenic, DMA, the sum of inorganic arsenic, methylarsonate and DMA, and total arsenic minus arsenobetaine as markers of inorganic arsenic exposure and/or metabolism need to address seafood intake. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between baseline adherence to three a priori dietary patterns (Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets) with 2-year changes in cognitive performance in older adults with overweight or obesity and high cardiovascular disease risk.Methods: A prospective cohort analysis was conducted within the PREDIMED-Plus trial, involving 6,647 men and women aged 55--75 years with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome. Using a validated, semiquantitative 143-item food frequency questionnaire completed at baseline, the dietary pattern adherence scores were calculated. An extensive neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted linear regression models were used to assess associations between 2-year changes in cognitive function z-scores across tertiles of baseline adherence to the a priori dietary patterns.Results: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet at baseline was associated with 2-year changes in the general cognitive screening Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, $\beta$: 0.070; 95{\%} CI: 0.014, 0.175, P-trend = 0.011), and two executive function-related assessments: the Trail Making Tests Part A (TMT-A, $\beta$: −0.054; 95{\%} CI: −0.110, − 0.002, P-trend = 0.047) and Part B (TMT-B, $\beta$: −0.079; 95{\%} CI: −0.134, −0.024, P-trend = 0.004). Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with the backward recall Digit Span Test assessment of working memory (DST-B, $\beta$: 0.058; 95{\%} CI: 0.002, 0.114, P-trend = 0.045). However, higher adherence to the DASH dietary pattern was not associated with better cognitive function over a period of 2 years.Conclusion: In older Spanish individuals with overweight or obesity and at high cardiovascular disease risk, higher baseline adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern may be associated with better cognitive performance than lower adherence over a period of 2 years.},

	abstract = {Human nails are composed of keratins, proteins that incorporate different elements and lipophilic chemicals as they grow. Given this characteristic, coupled with the ease of collection and storage and the potential to reflect multiple exposures occurring approximately 1 year ago, toenail concentrations are promising biomarkers of environmental exposures. In particular, research has focused on elemental concentration in toenail clippings. Although reporting baseline elemental concentrations in nails is useful for understanding how this biological material may reflect exposure, steps must be taken to validate the biomarker before widespread application. In particular, efforts should focus on relating the biomarker to estimated intake of the contaminant, exploring temporal stability of the biomarker concentration, and understanding the association with other known biological markers for the contaminant. A majority of work related to toenail biomarker validity has focused on arsenic and selenium; these studies suggest that toenails may be useful in measuring exposure to these elements. Further work should focus on validation of this potentially valuable biomarker for other contaminants of interest, while continuing to refine the exposure--biomarker association for arsenic and selenium.},

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid found to be an important groundwater contaminant of mainly natural geogenic origin worldwide particularly in large deltas and along major rivers in poor regions of South- and East-Asia. Excessive and long-term human intake of toxic inorganic As with food and water is causing arsenicosis, which is disfiguring, disabling, and leading to potentially fatal diseases like skin- and internal cancers. It is estimated that more than 100. million people mainly in developing countries are at risk. The arsenicosis situation in affected countries has been named the largest chemical threat to public health ever experienced and arsenicosis is spreading to regions where near-sterile well water loaded with As has replaced microbial suspect surface water containing lower As concentrations. This review provides an overview of the state of the art knowledge on the water and food As intake and exposure, and how the As chemistry in water and food may influence chosen mitigation strategies. Although reports on severe health effects from exposure to As in water are abundant there are several weak points in our knowledge on causes and prevalence of arsenicosis in order to devise effective mitigation. The main mitigation strategies focus on drinking water based on exploration of As-free water and As removal from extracted water, whereas mitigation strategies on cooking water and reducing exposure through food are quite often overlooked. The experiences of adopted low cost methods for lowering the human intake of As in rural areas are critically evaluated in terms of public acceptance, sustainability and impact on arsenicosis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Examples are given of how quantitative concepts in modem epidemiology influence the recognition of the causes of disease. The author uses the phenomenon of intensive swine production by vertically integrated agribusiness to illustrate how broad problems such as environmental racism, agricultural determinants of nutrition, loss of natural resources, and conditions conducive to emergence of new diseases are hidden by epidemiological approaches that fit into corporate policy perspectives.

	abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a chronic poison that causes severe skin lesions and cancer. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major dietary source of As; therefore, reducing As accumulation in the rice grain and thereby diminishing the amount of As that enters the food chain is of critical importance. Here, we report that a member of the Oryza sativa C-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (OsABCC) family, OsABCC1, is involved in the detoxification and reduction of As in rice grains. We found that OsABCC1 was expressed in many organs, including the roots, leaves, nodes, peduncle, and rachis. Expression was not affected when plants were exposed to low levels of As but was up-regulated in response to high levels of As. In both the basal nodes and upper nodes, which are connected to the panicle, OsABCC1 was localized to the phloem region of vascular bundles. Furthermore, OsABCC1 was localized to the tonoplast and conferred phytochelatin-dependent As resistance in yeast. Knockout of OsABCC1 in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to As, but did not affect cadmium toxicity. At the reproductive growth stage, the As content was higher in the nodes and in other tissues of wild-type rice than in those of OsABCC1 knockout mutants, but was significantly lower in the grain. Taken together, our results indicate that OsABCC1 limits As transport to the grains by sequestering As in the vacuoles of the phloem companion cells of the nodes in rice.},

In the present study, the relationship between iAs concentration in drinking water (contaminated at a median level of 10.5 µg/L) or As biomarkers (ie, urine and nails) and diabetes or prediabetes (defined as level of glycosylated hemoglobin - HbA1c -- higher than 6{\%}, self-reported diagnosis of diabetes by a physician, or the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs) was evaluated in 257 adults from Canada. For that we used logistic regression models and reported the odds ratio (OR) comparing participants in the 80th vs 20th percentile of iAs exposure indicators. The association between iAs exposure indicators and HbA1c was also explored for 234 adults and 35 children not taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs using a linear regression analysis. All models were controlled for confounding variables (age, gender, first-degree family history of diabetes, obesity or overweight in adults' model). We attempted to exclude adults with organic arsenic of marine origin in their urine by removing participants with detectable arsenobetaine or arsenocholine in urinary models. iAs biomarkers (toenail and urine) were not associated with diabetes or prediabetes in adults. iAs in well water was associated with a borderline significantly increased odds of diabetes or prediabetes (OR = 2.39; 95{\%} CI: 0.99--5.72). Higher well water iAs concentrations were significantly associated with increased HbA1c in both children and adults ($\beta$: 0.002; p = 0.041 and $\beta$: 0.003; p {\textless} 0.0001 respectively). In children, HbA1c was also associated with toenail As concentration ($\beta$: 0.18; p = 0.016). These results suggest low-level iAs exposure is associated with a continuum of dysglycemia.},

@article{Kapaj2006,
	abstract = {The ill effects of human exposure to arsenic (As) have recently been reevaluated by government agencies around the world. This has lead to a lowering of As guidelines in drinking water, with Canada decreasing the maximum allowable level from 50 to 25 $\mu$g/L and the U.S. from 50 to 10 $\mu$g/L. Canada is currently contemplating a further decrease to 5 $\mu$g/L. The reason for these regulatory changes is the realization that As can cause deleterious effects at lower concentrations than was previously thought. There is a strong relationship between chronic ingestion of As and deleterious human health effects and here we provide an overview of some of the major effects documented in the scientific literature. As regulatory levels of As have been decreased, an increasing number of water supplies will now require removal of As before the water can be used for human consumption. While As exposure can occur from food, air and water, all major chronic As poisonings have stemmed from water and this is usually the predominant exposure route. Exposure to As leads to an accumulation of As in tissues such as skin, hair and nails, resulting in various clinical symptoms such as hyperpigmentation and keratosis. There is also an increased risk of skin, internal organ, and lung cancers. Cardiovascular disease and neuropathy have also been linked to As consumption. Verbal IQ and long term memory can also be affected, and As can suppress hormone regulation and hormone mediated gene transcription. Increases in fetal loss and premature delivery, and decreased birth weights of infants, can occur even at low ({\textless}10 $\mu$g/L) exposure levels. Malnourished people have been shown to be more predisposed to As-related skin lesions. A large percentage of the population (30-40{\%}) that is using As-contaminated drinking water can have elevated As levels in urine, hair and nails, while showing no noticeable clinical symptoms, such as skin lesions. It is therefore important to carry out clinical tests of As exposure. Factors combining to increase/decrease the ill effects of As include duration and magnitude of As exposure, source of As exposure, nutrition, age and general health status. Analytical determinations of As poisoning can be made by examining As levels in urine, hair and toenails. Communities and individuals relying on groundwater sources for drinking water need to measure As levels to ensure that their supplies are safe. Communities with water As levels greater than 5 $\mu$g/L should consider a program to document As levels in the population. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

This study investigated total arsenic and arsenic speciation in rice using ion chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (IC-ICP-MS), covering the main rice-growing regions of the Iberian Peninsula in Europe. The main arsenic species found were inorganic and dimethylarsinic acid. Samples surveyed were soil, shoots and field-collected rice grain. From this information soil to plant arsenic transfer was investigated plus the distribution of arsenic in rice across the geographical regions of Spain and Portugal. Commercial polished rice was also obtained from each region and tested for arsenic speciation, showing a positive correlation with field-obtained rice grain. Commercial polished rice had the lowest i-As content in Andalucia, Murcia and Valencia while Extremadura had the highest concentrations. About 26{\%} of commercial rice samples exceeded the permissible concentration for infant food production as governed by the European Commission. Some cadmium data is also presented, available with ICP-MS analyses, and show low concentration in rice samples.},

	abstract = {Background In several volcanic areas of Italy, arsenic levels exceed European regulatory limits (10 $\mu$g/L in drinking water). There is still uncertainty about health risks from arsenic at low-medium doses ({\textless}100 $\mu$g/L). Objectives A large population-based study using an administrative cohort of residents in the Viterbo province (Central Italy), chronically exposed to low-medium arsenic levels via drinking water, was investigated to evaluate the effects of a lifetime exposure to arsenic on mortality from cancers and chronic diseases. Methods The study population consisted of 165,609 residents of 17 municipalities, followed from 1990 until 2010. Average individual arsenic exposure at the first residence (AsI) was estimated through a space-Time modeling approach using residential history and arsenic concentrations from water supply. A time-dependent Cumulative Arsenic dose Indicator (CAI) was calculated, accounting for daily water intake and exposure duration. Mortality Hazard Ratios (HR) were estimated by gender for different diseases using Cox proportional models, adjusting for individual and area-level confounders. A flexible non-parametric approach was used to investigate dose-response relationships. Results Mean AsI exposure was 19.3 $\mu$g/L, and average exposure duration was 39.5 years. Associations of AsI and CAI indicators with several diseases were found, with greatest risks found for lung cancer in both sexes (HR = 2.61 males; HR = 2.09 females), myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease and COPD in males (HR = 2.94; HR = 2.44; HR = 2.54 respectively) and diabetes in females (HR = 2.56). For lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases dose-response relationship is modelled by piecewise linear functions revealing effects even for doses lower than 10 $\mu$g/L, and no threshold dose value was identified as safe for health. Conclusions Results provide new evidence for risk assessment of low-medium concentrations of arsenic and contribute to the ongoing debate about the threshold-dose of effect, suggesting that even concentrations below 10 $\mu$g/L carry a mortality risk. Policy actions are urgently needed in areas exposed to arsenic like in the Viterbo province, to comply with current EU regulations. Copyright:},

@article{Williams2011,
	abstract = {Agroecological zones within Bangladesh with low levels of arsenic in groundwater and soils produce rice that is high in arsenic with respect to other producing regions of the globe. Little is known about arsenic cycling in these soils and the labile fractions relevant for plant uptake when flooded. Soil porewater dynamics of field soils (n = 39) were recreated under standardized laboratory conditions to investigate the mobility and interplay of arsenic, Fe, Si, C, and other elements, in relation to rice grain element composition, using the dynamic sampling technique diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). Based on a simple model using only labile DGT measured arsenic and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), concentrations of arsenic in Aman (Monsoon season) rice grain were predicted reliably. DOC was the strongest determinant of arsenic solid-solution phase partitioning, while arsenic release to the soil porewater was shown to be decoupled from that of Fe. This study demonstrates the dual importance of organic matter (OM), in terms of enhancing arsenic release from soils, while reducing bioavailability by sequestering arsenic in solution.},

@article{Cleland2009a,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determining arsenic exposure in groups based on geographic location, dietary behaviors, or lifestyles is important, as even moderate exposures may lead to health concerns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES/METHODS: The Korean community in Washington State, represents a group warranting investigation, as they consume foods (e.g., shellfish, rice, finfish, and seaweed) known to contain arsenic. As part of the Arsenic Mercury Intake Biometric Study, we examined the arsenic levels in hair and urine along with the diets of 108 women of childbearing age from within this community. Arsenic levels in indoor air and drinking water were also investigated, and shellfish commonly consumed were collected and analyzed for total and speciated arsenic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The six shellfish species analyzed (n = 667) contain total arsenic (range, 1-5 microg/g) but are a small source of inorganic arsenic (range, 0.01-0.12 microg/g). Six percent of the individuals may have elevated urinary inorganic arsenic levels ({\textgreater} 10 microg/L) due to diet. Seaweed, rice, shellfish, and finfish are principal sources for total arsenic intake/excretion based on mass balance estimates. Rice consumption (163 g/person/day) may be a significant source of inorganic arsenic. Air and water are not significant sources of exposure. Hair is a poor biometric for examining arsenic levels at low to moderate exposures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a portion of this community may have dietary inorganic arsenic exposure resulting in urine levels exceeding 10 microg/L. Although their exposure is below that associated with populations exposed to high levels of arsenic from drinking water ({\textgreater} 100 microg/L), their exposure may be among the highest in the United States.},

@article{Greenland1986,
	abstract = {Non-identifiability of parameters is a well-recognized problem in classical statistics, and Bayesian statisticians have long recognized the importance of exchangeability assumptions in making statistical inferences. A seemingly unrelated problem in epidemiology is that of confounding: bias in estimation of the effects of an exposure on disease risk, due to inherent differences in risk between exposed and unexposed individuals. Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to collapsibility-based definitions.},

@misc{Wright2010,
	abstract = {Exposure to environmental toxins during critical periods of prenatal and/or postnatal development may alter the normal course of lung morphogenesis and maturation, potentially resulting in changes that affect both structure and function of the respiratory system. Moreover, these early effects may persist into adult life magnifying the potential public health impact. Aberrant or excessive pro-inflammatory immune responses, occurring both locally and systemically, that result in inflammatory damage to the airway are a central determinant of lung structure-function changes throughout life. Disruption of neuroendocrine function in early development, specifically the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, may alter functional status of the immune system. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) function (sympathovagal imbalance) is another integral component of airway function and immunity in childhood. This overview discusses the evidence linking psychological factors to alterations in these interrelated physiological processes that may, in turn, influence childhood lung function and identifies gaps in our understanding. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
